Access to the upper unit is via the large 8' x 26' covered front porch. Inside the foyer, built-in cabinets provide extra storage and ample space for shoe racks. A newly installed light ensures safety upon entry. The cozy upper unit is slightly smaller, featuring a dining room that flows into the kitchen, living room, bathroom, and two bedrooms. An attic door has been sealed to prevent drafts. The kitchen boasts a large pantry and gas stove, as well as access to the enclosed back porch, offering added potential for tenant enjoyment. The property includes a two-car detached garage, with parking for the upper unit available to the side, accessible from the alleyway, while the lower unit has driveway parking. The current owners cover water costs and handle snow removal and lawn care. The lower unit has a signed one-year lease (until December 2024) at $775\/month, while the upper unit is on a month-to-month lease at $870\/month. This spring, the city will be replacing the lead pipes from the road to the house. The seller is working to get an anticipated timeline for the project.
