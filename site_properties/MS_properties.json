Blending modern comforts with a flare of retro vibes, 176 5th Ave #1 embodies a uniquely contemporary Brooklyn style. Soaring 11-foot-high ceilings lead into an open concept kitchen, living, and dining area. The high ceilings and open floor plan lend an impressive sense of size and scale to this floor, making it perfect for casual living or a fantastic place to host the most fab get togethers! A bi-level counter with a classic American diner feel frames the kitchen area, while two tone cabinetry compliments the stylish look and feel of this fully outfitted kitchen. Pendant lights hang gracefully over the island, adding both style and illumination. A pantry with additional storage overhead offers practical space for kitchen essentials. The dining area is anchored by a striking 1960s vintage Italian pendant lamp by Harvey Guzzini, providing a designer touch. The kitchen's counter then wraps its way around into the living space, continuing the charm while adding storage underneath. Painted brick walls lend texture and warmth to the space as dimmable overhead lighting and a ceiling fan ensures comfort and convenience. The high ceilings make for spacious walls to hang all of your artwork and combines seamlessly with built-in bookshelves. A convenient powder room is perfectly placed away from the main living area. The private backyard is lush and fabulous! Ideal for hosting or as your private retreat, throughout the year you'll find a diverse array of plant life including a cherry laurel tree, eastern redbud tree, hydrangeas, English ivy, creeping jenny, and many more. The recently improved and oversized deck makes this space an incredible extension of your living area. Upstairs, both bedrooms are oversized and are equipped with ceiling fans and recessed overhead lighting. The primary bedroom features a walk-in closet with custom storage and is home to a full size, vented washer and dryer. The second bedroom and hallway showcase painted brick, adding continuity with the first-floor aesthetic. Quietly facing the back of the building 176 5th Ave #1 is part of a 6 unit, pet friendly co-op that is located in the best part of 5th Ave in prime Park Slope. The best cafes, restaurants, shops, transportation and everything else that makes Park Slope one of Brooklyn's most sought-after neighborhoods is just outside your doorstep.","style":"COOP","full_street_line":"176 5th Ave Apt 1","street":"176 5th Ave","unit":"Apt 1","city":"Brooklyn","state":"NY","zip_code":"11217","beds":2,"full_baths":null,"half_baths":null,"sqft":null,"year_built":1920,"days_on_mls":71,"list_price":1500000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-01-08","sold_price":1635000,"last_sold_date":"2025-03-20","assessed_value":null,"estimated_value":1559100,"tax":null,"tax_history":null,"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":null,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":40.677486,"longitude":-73.979889,"neighborhoods":"Park Slope, South Brooklyn, North Slope","county":"Kings","fips_code":"36047","stories":4,"hoa_fee":1105,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"3161883","agent_name":"Anthony Robles","agent_email":"anthony@space-ms.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"(212) 668-0001"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-DENY-ATRO","agent_nrds_id":null,"broker_id":null,"broker_name":null,"builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":null,"office_mls_set":"O-DENY-106","office_name":"UNKNOWN NAME","office_email":"lead.manager@elliman.com","office_phones":[{"number":"7182303201","type":null,"primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"NEW DAWN CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL, New York City Geographic District #13, New York City Special Schools -

The house is one of remarkable contrasts: it is earthy yet refined; it is cozy yet open and bright; it is quiet and private yet moments from one of Brooklyn's bustling epicenters. Spanning two stories plus a finished, and windowed, semi-grade level, the house offers exceedingly low monthlies and a high-end (but, of course, fitting) renovation, making it a delightful alternative to a cookie-cutter condo. Entering from the garden level, oversized western windows facing the garden allow generous light into the living space. 12 pine board flooring complements the whitewashed exposed brick walls and the steel and wood stairway. The chef's kitchen, with windows facing the trees on Nevins, is outfitted with high-end appliances, including a six-burner Blue Star range and a Viking refrigerator. The countertops are marble, wood, and stainless steel, a design that is both aesthetic and practical. Adjacent to the kitchen and living room, the 20-foot-deep back yard offers a peaceful, private extension of the home. Clean pebble gravel and minimalist green planters shape a serene space, ideal for quiet mornings or relaxed afternoons outside. The principal bedroom suite is upstairs. The bedroom spans the full width of the house, complete with five floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the landscaped yard. Multiple skylights and the additional eastern exposure makes this a bright and airy floor. The en-suite bath is finished in beautiful, emerald Bisazza tiles and high-end Samuel Heath fixtures. A second bedroom offers ample storage and is easily used as a home office, a dressing room, or a nursery. On the finished cellar level, find a flexible-use space which could serve as a bedroom, den or home office, offering character-rich finishes like exposed beam ceilings, radiant heat flooring and a recessed picture window. A second full bathroom and laundry facilities are also located on this level. The current owners recently completed significant updates to the building systems and structure, including replacing the roof and installing an advanced air filtration system. Located on a quiet block in a coveted Boerum Hill historic district, this home enjoys close proximity to Brooklyn's cultural corridor BAM, Barclays, Prospect and Fort Greene Parks as well as world renowned restaurants and cafes are just moments away.","style":"TOWNHOMES","full_street_line":"112 Nevins St","street":"112 Nevins St","unit":null,"city":"Brooklyn","state":"NY","zip_code":"11217","beds":2,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":null,"sqft":null,"year_built":1852,"days_on_mls":21,"list_price":2995000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-04-28","sold_price":2950000,"last_sold_date":"2021-08-25","assessed_value":80340,"estimated_value":3034852,"tax":4022,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":4022,"assessment":{"building":71640,"land":8700,"total":80340}},{"year":2023,"tax":4036,"assessment":{"building":73920,"land":8700,"total":82620}},{"year":2022,"tax":3743,"assessment":{"building":81840,"land":8700,"total":90540}},{"year":2021,"tax":3723,"assessment":{"building":90600,"land":8700,"total":99300}},{"year":2020,"tax":3533,"assessment":{"building":101940,"land":8700,"total":110640}},{"year":2019,"tax":3491,"assessment":{"building":99960,"land":8700,"total":108660}},{"year":2018,"tax":3465,"assessment":{"building":15199,"land":1365,"total":16564}},{"year":2017,"tax":3185,"assessment":{"building":13595,"land":2032,"total":15627}},{"year":2016,"tax":2947,"assessment":{"building":12155,"land":2588,"total":14743}},{"year":2015,"tax":2719,"assessment":{"building":10250,"land":3659,"total":13909}},{"year":2014,"tax":2380,"assessment":{"building":8599,"land":3824,"total":12423}},{"year":2013,"tax":2249,"assessment":{"building":7393,"land":4328,"total":11721}},{"year":2012,"tax":2013,"assessment":{"building":913,"land":10146,"total":11059}},{"year":2010,"tax":1875,"assessment":{"building":890,"land":10169,"total":11059}},{"year":2009,"tax":1769,"assessment":{"building":3962,"land":7012,"total":10974}},{"year":2007,"tax":1223,"assessment":{"building":8018,"land":1198,"total":9216}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":null,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":40.685214,"longitude":-73.983435,"neighborhoods":"South Brooklyn, Boerum Hill","county":"Kings","fips_code":"36047","stories":null,"hoa_fee":null,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"2108231","agent_name":"Nick Gavin","agent_email":"nick.gavin@compass.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"6466103055"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"2129139058"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-UCNY-NICK GAVIN","agent_nrds_id":null,"broker_id":"2107942","broker_name":"Compass","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"2930336","office_mls_set":"O-UCNY-COMPASS","office_name":"Compass","office_email":"agentexperience@compass.com","office_phones":[{"number":"2129139058","type":"Office","primary":true,"ext":null},{"number":"4046686621","type":"Mobile","primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"New York City Special Schools -

it's a lifestyle.

It has been lovingly maintained by its current owners since 2006 and is now ready for new Stewards to create memories and maintain its historical integrity. The home is configured and recorded as a legal 2-family, with a large, garden-level one bedroom and stately four bedroom triplex above. It's built 45 deep on a 100 lush, south-facing lot and has approximately 450 sf of unused FAR, allowing for a valuable 2-story addition to be created. The home features a rarely seen triple parlor with 12 ceilings and intricate plaster moldings, working fireplaces, original hardwood floors, pocket window shutters, and a cleverly hidden 4 year old CAC system. The kitchen and baths are in a simple European style. The current owners even located a large ceramic tub from the famed Plaza Hotel that was craned into the primary suite. The top floor of the home has enormous rooms with a pitched roof, large closets, and a skylit hallway above the wide original staircase.

This exquisite 5-level residence merges historic architecture with modern functionality, offering five bedrooms, four full bathrooms, and three half-baths. Highlights of this special home include a 10-foot, full-width extension across the rear of the home's lower two levels along with a Parlor level extension, and a wide-span of custom windows and doors on the garden and parlor levels which opens the rear of the home to the garden, flooding the interiors with natural light and seamlessly merging indoor and outdoor living. Additional components of the renovation include new plumbing and electrical systems, nine-zone hydroponic radiant floor heating, eleven-zone air conditioning, full-house water filtration, a Level 2 electric vehicle charging setup at the curb, intelligently designed mechanical systems that are tucked away so as to not detract from the home's beautiful finishes, and integrated smart home systems. Currently arranged as a single-family home, the property's layout allows for the lower two floors to serve as a separate duplex with its own kitchen and living spaces.

You really CAN have it all in this rare 2 bed, 2 bath CONDO that also includes rights to the entire rooftop, plus a woodburning fireplace, vented full-size washer and dryer, split AC units, and low monthlies, all in prime north Park Slope! Enjoy the feeling of living in a treehouse with incredible light flooding in through south-facing windows, and a graceful internal staircase with massive windows that allows light to cascade down into your home AND takes you easily up to your private roofdeck. This really is a dream come true and allows you to spread out comfortably on the entire top floor of a wide and deep historic brownstone and enjoy the low common charges and taxes of a condo, and none of the restrictions of a coop. Head up an elegant stoop and just two additional floors higher, and you will see that the walkup is well worth it. Enjoy a landing for personal storage, and then enter into a light-filled great room with a superb chef's kitchen, and ample space for living AND dining. A shaker-style kitchen has been outfitted with professional Frigidaire stainless steel appliances that include a 36 French door fridge, gas range, dishwasher, and deep undermount sink. White quartz countertops ensure that your kitchen is stylish AND practical. An amber glass backsplash adds a whimsical touch. There is ample space to add a rolling island as well, should you desire. The space easily accommodates a dining table with skyline views, plus a generous living room, all within range of enjoying your very own woodburning fireplace with its historic exposed-brick face and black limestone mantle. Head towards the back of the apartment, past a luxurious full-size and VENTED washer and dryer, and a full bathroom replete with soothing travertine floors and walls, a deep jacuzzi tub and spacious marble-topped vanity. The second bedroom is nicely sized with a large closet. A wonderfully proportioned primary suite enjoys a private balcony with bird's-eye views of the pastoral backyards of brownstone Brooklyn, two closets, and a Carrara-marble clad full bath with a glass-enclosed shower and spacious vanity. An absolutely incredible opportunity awaits as you head up a custom wood stairwell into a loft-like bulkhead from your living room up to the massive private roof-deck complete with gas hookup, water and electricity. The building re-did the entire roof and bulkhead last year, and the current owner has left the roof in perfect condition for the new owner to customize to their heart's delight. It is rare that a roof space is so easily accessible and ready for you to build the outdoor space of your dreams with no headaches from an older underlying roof. Enjoy extra indoor space in the bulkhead area, perfect for a sunny home office or abundant storage space for outdoor items. The views are truly spectacular with panoramic peeks over the rooftops and steeples of brownstone Brooklyn, all the way to lower Manhattan. And of course, don't miss all that this part of Park Slope has to offer. Situated on a picturesque block in the North Slope, easy to access Manhattan, you will have Prospect Park and every subway line at your doorstep (2\/3\/4\/5\/Q\/B\/D\/R\/N), in addition to an incredible array of shops, restaurants and amenities on 5th, 6th and 7th avenues and Flatbush. This building has unexpectedly low common charges, and has also just completed a major capital improvement project on the roof, fa ade and mechanicals, ensuring low monthlies into the forseeable future.

Finally, a home which is absolutely up-to-the-minute in its renovations, while polished to perfection in its restorations. The owner of this home carried out meticulous work to revive the original details. Plaster designs on the ceiling and walls were restored to match the original throughout the parlor floor by talented craftsmen. Woodwork was honed to its original glow. Fretwork, a huge pier mirror, and double mahogany doors were restored to frame the lovely double parlor. The kitchen and dining room feature an ornate decorative fireplace, as well as stained glass transoms over the double doors that lead to the garden. The Parlor floor features built-in Blue Sound speakers, fantastic for entertaining. To complement the original home, the owner has added every update required by the serious townhouse owner. There is a Daikon electric HVAC system that provides heat and air conditioning to 5 separate zones in the house at a very reasonable average monthly cost. The kitchen, boasting granite countertops and a marble backsplash, is a cook's dream. The wall ovens and range are Wolf; the fridge is Sub-Zero. The layout of the upper floors, which also have beautiful original details throughout, is smart and flexible. Above the parlor floor, there are two large bedrooms (one of which is used as a den or media room), one airy bathroom, and a laundry room. On the top floor, there is another bathroom and bedroom, as well as a smartly designed primary suite. The suite has its own bathroom, a windowed desk area, and a spacious walk-in closet. There is even a powder room on the parlor floor. All bathrooms in the house were replaced, and an additional en-suite bath was added to the primary bedroom. The outdoor space is special. Facing south is a deck off the kitchen with plenty of space for dining and grilling. Steps lead to a lush, landscaped garden with mature plantings, ranging from a small grove of birch trees to a Japanese maple to a variety of evergreens (garden photos coming soon). Further smart design is demonstrated in the one-bedroom garden apartment, which can be rented or not. And the cherry on top is a built-out basement currently used as a gym, with room for every type of equipment one might need.

Commuters will love the unbeatable location: less than five minutes to Atlantic Terminal, where nine subway lines, and the LIRR put the rest of NYC (and Montauk) at your fingertips.","style":"CONDOS","full_street_line":"657 Warren St Apt 3A","street":"657 Warren St","unit":"Apt 3A","city":"Brooklyn","state":"NY","zip_code":"11217","beds":3,"full_baths":1,"half_baths":1,"sqft":null,"year_built":1988,"days_on_mls":3,"list_price":1250000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-05-16","sold_price":999999,"last_sold_date":"2016-05-05","assessed_value":64393,"estimated_value":1276300,"tax":2432,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":2432,"assessment":{"building":60589,"land":3804,"total":64393}},{"year":2023,"tax":2320,"assessment":{"building":57609,"land":3804,"total":61413}},{"year":2022,"tax":2152,"assessment":{"building":52816,"land":3804,"total":56620}},{"year":2021,"tax":2140,"assessment":{"building":47937,"land":3804,"total":51741}},{"year":2020,"tax":2152,"assessment":{"building":28294,"land":3804,"total":32098}},{"year":2019,"tax":2111,"assessment":{"building":24106,"land":3804,"total":27910}},{"year":2018,"tax":1992,"assessment":{"building":8070,"land":1453,"total":9523}},{"year":2017,"tax":1831,"assessment":{"building":7505,"land":1479,"total":8984}},{"year":2016,"tax":1694,"assessment":{"building":6592,"land":1884,"total":8476}},{"year":2015,"tax":1657,"assessment":{"building":5932,"land":2544,"total":8476}},{"year":2014,"tax":1611,"assessment":{"building":5382,"land":3030,"total":8412}},{"year":2013,"tax":1261,"assessment":{"building":4506,"land":3430,"total":7936}},{"year":2012,"tax":899,"assessment":{"building":4127,"land":3360,"total":7487}},{"year":2010,"tax":399,"assessment":{"building":3260,"land":3804,"total":7064}},{"year":2009,"tax":191,"assessment":{"building":4991,"land":2214,"total":7205}},{"year":2007,"tax":173,"assessment":{"building":5163,"land":2214,"total":7377}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":null,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":40.68061,"longitude":-73.978271,"neighborhoods":"North Slope, South Brooklyn, Park Slope","county":"Kings","fips_code":"36047","stories":4,"hoa_fee":531,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"4869046","agent_name":"Peter Perez","agent_email":"peter.perez@elliman.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"BUSINESS_MOBILE","number":"3472318614"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-DENY-PPER","agent_nrds_id":null,"broker_id":null,"broker_name":null,"builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":null,"office_mls_set":"O-DENY-106","office_name":"UNKNOWN NAME","office_email":"lead.manager@elliman.com","office_phones":[{"number":"7182303201","type":null,"primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"New York City Geographic District #13, New York City Special Schools - District 75","primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d6bba3203f31e4611fd84eb4d7b4961el-m285457657od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d6bba3203f31e4611fd84eb4d7b4961el-m285457657od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d6bba3203f31e4611fd84eb4d7b4961el-m1086604581od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d6bba3203f31e4611fd84eb4d7b4961el-m2550600889od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d6bba3203f31e4611fd84eb4d7b4961el-m2423692177od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d6bba3203f31e4611fd84eb4d7b4961el-m1071599140od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d6bba3203f31e4611fd84eb4d7b4961el-m3730156593od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d6bba3203f31e4611fd84eb4d7b4961el-m3123020262od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d6bba3203f31e4611fd84eb4d7b4961el-m114226489od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/144-Park-Pl-Apt-3_Brooklyn_NY_11217_M33493-04384","property_id":"3349304384","listing_id":"2980839305","mls":"UCNY","mls_id":"1798760157055995497","status":"FOR_SALE","text":"Prime Park Slope studio with sleeping loft, features abundant Southern light, beautiful pre-war details and high ceilings.

At 20 feet wide and set deep on a 100-foot lot, No. 62 quietly commands attention. Wrapped in Flemish bond red brick and penciled limestone, it offers the kind of presence that feels both grounded and poetic. There's a certain magnetism to both the house and the park block-something that feels like best-in-show. That doesn't need to announce itself. It just is. Tree-lined Fort Greene Place gives the home its frame-dappled light, soft movement, a sense of place. Leafy streets and vibrant corridors surround you, while Fort Greene Park becomes an everyday companion. The house offers flexibility without compromise. For investors and end-users alike. Make use of it as-is-two updated, independent units-or rewrite the entire structure as a single, soulful residence. Whether you dream of several units or one forever home, there's a kind of abracadabra in the way this house adapts to what your possibilities need. Spanning round 6, 000 square feet across five levels (plus cellar), you'll find over 5, 000 square feet of interior living and another 1, 600 outside. Nearly 70 feet deep and full-width across each level, the scale is valuable-and lasting. Inside, a lovely blend of preserved historic features and thoughtful updates sets the tone. This match made with contemporary reconstruction presents a wonderful opportunity to live, love, and discover in the heart of one of Brooklyn's most historic districts, now and a century ago. It is head turning to notice that one place could contain all that magnificence. The home lives across multiple levels, with generous rooms, and adaptable layouts that invite both retreat and connection. Light moves beautifully throughout-and the space flows in a way that feels right. The triplex offers elegance and ease. With a graceful parlor floor, and a second-story salon, there's room for quiet moments and large gatherings alike. Upstairs, lofted studios bring in warmth and creativity-exposed brick, tall ceilings, light from above. The kitchen is a quiet standout, dressed in soft gray-blue cabinetry, veined white marble, and steel appliances. All three bathrooms have been redone. Throughout the home: oak inlaid floors, fine millwork, antique pier mirrors, marble mantels, mahogany pocket and patio doors, prominent crown moldings and medallions, skylight apertures, and just enough patina to whisper history. Recessed lighting, central air, and en suite laundry offer up-to-date comfort, while a pair of open-air terraces off the kitchen and second floor add layers of outdoor living. The garden-level flat has the feel of being an intimate, open, and stylistically contemporary loft. More than that, it has enough storage and a focal point island. A dining area and a full bathroom complete the floor, with two additional rooms leading out to the patio and a deep, divinely verdant yard. Beloved Fort Greene is well located. Proximity to bridges, public transit, and highways ensures excellent access throughout Brooklyn and beyond. Your essential staples and amenities are within blocks. And In terms of the various cuisines and spirits, whether you fancy a first-rate, quick, or casual meal, all are accessible in this popular and preferred neighborhood. This is a home that lends itself to gathering and solitude alike-a space to celebrate, retreat, and live fully. A place where narrative and structure meet and where everyday life feels inspired. A timeless residence with soul, scale, and story-ready to welcome its next chapter.

This delightful two-family wood frame house was built in 1858 in the Italianate style. Pass through the wrought-iron gate, enter the foyer and up one flight to the owner's triplex. The living room has historic floor-to-ceiling windows accented with lovely stained glass overlooking the quiet, tree-lined Dean Street. The spacious living room includes a wall of built-in book shelves facing a cozy marble mantlepiece. A bright and pleasant kitchen with stainless steel appliances occupies the center area with a large, sunny dining room that opens onto a private deck for your south-facing enjoyment. Outdoor stairs lead down to a deep backyard garden with brick paving and perimeter planting. From the kitchen area, take the graceful center staircase up to the bedroom floor. Two smaller rooms face the back yard, with a large, primary bedroom featuring beautiful, Palladian windows and an ensuite powder room gracing the front of the home. This floor also has a full bathroom and a secret stair to the attic studio, which is perfect for a home office, exercise room, overflow guests, play room or creative pursuits. There is a large convenient storage space as well. At ground level is a large income producing 1-bedroom rental which duplexes down to the windowed basement level, ideal as a studio or rec space. 240 Dean Street is close to some of Brooklyn's favorite restaurants: enjoy the excellent Rucola one block away, French Louie's or Grand Army for oysters and cocktails just around the corner. Some of the best shopping Brooklyn has to offer can be found just two blocks away on Atlantic Avenue, and nearly every subway line is within 4 blocks.","style":"TOWNHOMES","full_street_line":"240 Dean St","street":"240 Dean St","unit":null,"city":"Brooklyn","state":"NY","zip_code":"11217","beds":4,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":1,"sqft":2600,"year_built":1910,"days_on_mls":68,"list_price":3400000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-03-12","sold_price":1390000,"last_sold_date":"2009-10-05","assessed_value":170520,"estimated_value":3213800,"tax":6735,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":6735,"assessment":{"building":143220,"land":27300,"total":170520}},{"year":2023,"tax":6461,"assessment":{"building":150360,"land":27300,"total":177660}},{"year":2022,"tax":6351,"assessment":{"building":167340,"land":27300,"total":194640}},{"year":2021,"tax":6333,"assessment":{"building":141540,"land":27300,"total":168840}},{"year":2020,"tax":6262,"assessment":{"building":148380,"land":27300,"total":175680}},{"year":2019,"tax":5845,"assessment":{"building":133080,"land":27300,"total":160380}},{"year":2018,"tax":5546,"assessment":{"building":21488,"land":5024,"total":26512}},{"year":2017,"tax":5404,"assessment":{"building":22026,"land":4486,"total":26512}},{"year":2016,"tax":5013,"assessment":{"building":20350,"land":4731,"total":25081}},{"year":2015,"tax":4821,"assessment":{"building":17675,"land":6982,"total":24657}},{"year":2014,"tax":4461,"assessment":{"building":16616,"land":6672,"total":23288}},{"year":2013,"tax":4240,"assessment":{"building":14499,"land":7595,"total":22094}},{"year":2012,"tax":4022,"assessment":{"building":9973,"land":12121,"total":22094}},{"year":2010,"tax":3511,"assessment":{"building":9107,"land":11794,"total":20901}},{"year":2009,"tax":3080,"assessment":{"building":6054,"land":14494,"total":20548}},{"year":2007,"tax":2642,"assessment":{"building":16540,"land":1872,"total":18412}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":null,"price_per_sqft":1308,"latitude":40.684781,"longitude":-73.984049,"neighborhoods":"South Brooklyn, Boerum Hill","county":"Kings","fips_code":"36047","stories":null,"hoa_fee":null,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":null,"agent_name":null,"agent_email":null,"agent_phones":null,"agent_mls_set":null,"agent_nrds_id":null,"broker_id":null,"broker_name":null,"builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"2930336","office_mls_set":"O-UCNY-COMPASS","office_name":"Compass","office_email":"agentexperience@compass.com","office_phones":[{"number":"2129139058","type":"Office","primary":true,"ext":null},{"number":"4046686621","type":"Mobile","primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"New York City Special Schools -

The ample living space is designed to integrate indoor and outdoor living with soaring 10-foot plus ceilings, with warm blonde wide oak flooring, framed by ultra-large windows that lead to your private outdoor living room. The layout is truly remarkable and built for how people want to live today. The thoughtful details continue in each of the two large bedrooms of Residence 2C. They all have luxurious bathrooms, an abundance of built-out closet space, and multiple light exposures. The primary bedroom suite has a floor-to-ceiling glass door opening to a secluded terrace. The primary en-suite bathroom boasts radiant flooring and a curved ceiling and a textured glass clerestory window, which lets in soft morning light hitting the matte white tiles and marble floating countertop. Throughout the rest of the home, you'll find advanced details such as discreet linear HVAC diffusers, in-residence Bosch washer\/dryers, frameless flush doors, and museum finish floating walls. We invite you to visit 450 Warren to explore these special residences in more depth and welcome you to call us directly to arrange private showings. Experiencing 450 Warren is incomparable. Upon entering the building is an indoor elevator lobby enclosed in curved floor-to-ceiling glass, along with an outdoor sculptural stairway rising into the central atrium with fully grown trees that open to the sky. Open-air walkways are laced with a nearly transparent woven metal mesh that fully encloses the walkways with plantings. Both more beautiful and safer than traditional railings, this revolutionary design provides an ever-changing environment that reflects the light and seasons, while the walkway floors are protected from the elements to prevent ice and snow with radiant heat. You can say goodbye to the experience of walking through a cavernous hallway to your apartment. At 450 Warren every walk home is adjacent to greenery with light and air leading to your private foyer. The amenities of the building are designed to foster community with shared spaces for living and relaxing together. In addition to the central atrium, there is a spacious open air courtyard and garden on the second floor, where residents are immersed in greenery native to the area along with a reconfigurable co-working lounge and a boutique gym perfect for those morning yoga sessions. A pet wash, bicycle storage, and parking for purchase are also within the building.","style":"CONDOS","full_street_line":"450 Warren St # Twoc","street":"450 Warren St","unit":"# Twoc","city":"Brooklyn","state":"NY","zip_code":"11217","beds":2,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":null,"sqft":1239,"year_built":2021,"days_on_mls":76,"list_price":1799000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-03-04","sold_price":null,"last_sold_date":null,"assessed_value":null,"estimated_value":null,"tax":null,"tax_history":null,"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":12500,"price_per_sqft":1452,"latitude":40.68354,"longitude":-73.986832,"neighborhoods":"Gowanus, South Brooklyn","county":"Kings","fips_code":"36047","stories":null,"hoa_fee":697,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"1826500","agent_name":"Behzad Amiri","agent_email":"behzad.amiri@corcoran.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"7188104012"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-CCRN-438E1E54-E3C6-4C18-B70C-4A834F4CE596","agent_nrds_id":null,"broker_id":"1825618","broker_name":"NRT -Corcoran - NY","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"1825627","office_mls_set":"O-CCRN-6F4D44B7-5D80-4951-8CE1-2BEB14D549BD","office_name":"Corcoran Park Slope","office_email":"ben.elesh@corcoran.com","office_phones":[{"number":"7184993700","type":"Office","primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"New York City Special Schools - District 75, NEW DAWN CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL, New York City Geographic District #15","primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m3645549157od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m3645549157od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m2610082206od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m1095275838od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m2007508694od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m2595888215od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m731199763od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m3308194200od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m1635847488od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m2610349560od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m299266232od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m2932330696od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m352156490od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m3477178563od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m1100718325od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m634091447od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m2346261342od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m4086848221od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m1345229485od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m3298480024od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m2807870060od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m2863017526od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m1352820837od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a25781787a74159548d053802aea089cl-m1917463881od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/34-Saint-Johns-Pl_Brooklyn_NY_11217_M49709-24749","property_id":"4970924749","listing_id":"2981000344","mls":"CCRN","mls_id":"69fde401-e269-4e9a-b05a-9c09a381651e","status":"FOR_SALE","text":"Welcome to 34 St John's Place in Prime Park Slope - a superbly renovated townhouse offering beautifully preserved original details along with gorgeous modern elements with 5-6 bedrooms, three and a half baths and a spectacular 75-foot landscaped garden.

Introducing Residence PH703W, a truly exceptional four-bedroom, three and a half bath home that seamlessly blends traditional elegance with modern sophistication. Spanning an expansive 2, 830 square feet, this distinctive residence welcomes you with a formal foyer leading into an open, airy layout enhanced by soaring 10'3 ceilings. Designed for both comfortable living and stylish entertaining, this impressive home features South, West and Northern exposures, oversized windows that flood the interiors with natural light, and a private 1, 070 square foot roof terrace. Outfitted with a temperature-controlled plunge pool, built-in gas grill, and sweeping open views, the terrace offers a perfect setting for dining al fresco, lounging, or hosting under the stars. Designed with a focus on simplicity as a way of life, with interiors designed by AD100 Workstead that layer elegance and function that read intimate and warm. The oversized kitchen presents ample storage in custom white oak cabinetry adorned with custom white oak hardware that is beautifully paired with a honed Taj Mahal quartzite clad island with a striking waterfall effect, backsplash and ledge. The integrated state-of-the-art Masterpiece Series Thermador appliance package blends seamlessly into the background and includes a directly-vented 36 5-burner cooktop, two 30 ovens and 30 speed-oven, 36 refrigerator column, 24 freezer column and an 18 wine refrigerator column. The custom light pendant designed by Workstead calls attention to the many thoughtful design details. Adjacent to the kitchen is a custom designed wet bar in a China-White finish with bronze hardware, Kalahari Exotic stone countertop and backsplash, and complete with two refrigerator drawers, bar sink and storage. The bathrooms at Bergen are outfitted with soft tones and warm wood accents that make for a spa-like oasis with materials that are crafted to last. The sun-soaked five-piece primary suite is complete with honed Crema Vanilla marble wall and floor tiles, a custom white oak vanity with Crema Vanilla marble countertop, legs and ledge, a soaking tub clad in honed Crema Vanilla marble at the deck and skirt and a glass enclosed shower and separate water closet.

Subtle touches include wall-mounted fixtures, and a custom Workstead designed wall sconce. Nestled into a serene tree lined street in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, Bergen features 105 residences by renowned architect Frida Escobedo. Driven by neighborhood context, the facade takes inspiration from the quintessential bay-window brownstones, interpreting the geometry and materiality in a contemporary manner. Composed from handmade geometric modules, the facade elegantly weaves light, shadow and air throughout each residence, revealing crafted finishes and honoring the natural environment. With a highly curated collection of indoor and outdoor amenities, focused on community, health, wellness, and the arts, Bergen provides a universal sense of belonging. Bergen's Glass House, the source of equilibrium between the East and West residential wings, connects multiple amenity levels through a custom circular stair. Amenity highlights include a full time attended lobby, a ceramic studio led by BKLYN Clay, a private park for residents and two carefully landscaped common roof spaces with gas grills and fire pits designed by DXA Studio and Patrick Cullina.
