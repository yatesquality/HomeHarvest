desirable location, Riverside in Gill. This two family was originally a side by side. The previous owners decided to adjoin the upstairs bedrooms giving them more space. The second original stairwell still exists and can be easily returned to it's original side by side status or kept as is with a single bedroom apartment down stairs on one side. New roof, siding and chimney's. Recently freshened up. Owners side has a very nice deck with gazebo. Newly fenced in yard with large storage shed plus a single car garage. Great for a owner occupied that would like some additional rental income or use the smaller apartment as in in-law.

Upstairs on the second floor a wide-open great room is bathed in coastal light and sea breezes. There is a chefs kitchen with a commercial grade stove at one end and sliders lead to a large deck just off the living area. 2nd Full bath off the kitchen. On the first floor there are two guest bedrooms and a large ensuite master with a walk-in closet that's large enough to be a home office. Full basement with laundry and a one car garage. Sunbathe on the large freestanding deck perched in the back yard. Recent updates include a brand-new 3 BR septic system, fresh paint inside and out, a new roof, and skylights.

Ranch option in a special neighborhood. Have a look at this expanded Ranch with two-car front loading garage. Exceptional corner lot in a quaint little subdivision just outside the Bicknell Town Forest. This little gem sits nicely on a wooded lot with a large flat yard. Inside you'll find three bedrooms and 2 baths (a full and 3\/4). The living room has hardwood flooring that runs through to all 3 bedrooms. Large Eat-In kitchen leads out to the enclosed porch just past the 3\/4 bath w\/laundry. Lots of great features here including newer roof, beautiful hardwood, large basement spaces with bonus room and spare room for office or additional bedroom, first floor laundry, workshop, two storage sheds, excess space for parking, large back yard with raised bed garden area and more. This one is a winner and the location is top-notch.

Were looking for an exciting urban life but wed also like the quiet of a suburban neighborhood, you know what I mean? Is this too much to ask? We surely need a yard. And parking. And central air would be amazing! And then three weeks of underwhelming open houses spin by, and, shoulders slumped, buyers realize that a number of compromises will need to be made.

Sited on a large, level lot on one of Norwell's most scenic roads, it underwent an extensive renovation  in 2018.  The owners created a stunning family room designed by local architect Sally Weston and it has become the heart of this home, with soaring ceilings and a rear facing wall of windows.  The kitchen renovation brought everything up to date while retaining the historic character of this 1880 beauty.  A lovely mudroom (equipped with vintage farmer's sink) is both practical & charming.  Both bathrooms were included in the renovation.  Gardeners will be delighted with the large, flat lot where the current owners have maintained extensive vegetable & flower gardens and where a chicken coop awaits new residents.

Historic Colson Ebenezer 1783 Homestead. This Spectacular farm set on 43 acres with open pasture and massive horse barn. This 1783 cape with expansive additions includes 13 rooms with 6 bedrooms and 6 baths. The original Cape still holds much of the Historical integrity from the 18th century. The property was a horse farm. A barn with 5 stalls and a second level for hay storage leads to plenty of open acreage. There are trails lined with maples and stone walls and a picturesque stream. The home is in need of extensive repair and mechanical updating. The price reflects that you will need a sizable investment to return it to its past charm. There is a move in ready attached cottage with a loft bedroom so you can stay on your property as you bring it back to life. This is the ideal property for a buyer looking to authentically restore an 18th century homestead. FIRST SHOWINGS TO START ON SATURDAY APRIL 12TH Buyers and Agents to use extreme caution when viewing the property.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"27 Broom St","street":"27 Broom St","unit":null,"city":"Plainfield","state":"MA","zip_code":"01070","beds":6,"full_baths":6,"half_baths":null,"sqft":4363,"year_built":1783,"days_on_mls":35,"list_price":495000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-04-10","sold_price":495000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-15","assessed_value":444700,"estimated_value":485100,"tax":8218,"tax_history":[{"year":2025,"tax":8218,"assessment":{"building":391300,"land":53400,"total":444700}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":1899652,"price_per_sqft":113,"latitude":42.50984,"longitude":-72.89897,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Hampshire","fips_code":"25015","stories":null,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"596349","agent_name":"JAMES ADAMS","agent_email":"adamsrealty4@gmail.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Home","number":"4132057580"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-BSMA-M0000692","agent_nrds_id":null,"broker_id":null,"broker_name":"Hilltown Real Estate by Adams Realty","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":null,"office_mls_set":"O-BSMA-AN4940","office_name":"Hilltown Real Estate By Adams Realty","office_email":null,"office_phones":[{"number":"4132380300","type":null,"primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"Mohawk Trail School District","primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m3135009268od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m3135009268od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m3459539408od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m3778050742od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m1175644819od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m1835515000od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m30462450od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m2093158263od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m4113631079od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m707233177od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m3310361682od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m121555644od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m2456114539od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m3738506587od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m1088824623od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m674122928od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m1384955877od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m3874757512od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m677227372od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m2647126595od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m3268088500od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m4213835018od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m3794998884od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m3795590622od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m1719876935od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m2470993582od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m2527563546od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/9c9bfd84e678281897f147bcfb7bdbedl-m2045082963od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/13-Sawgrass-Ln_Southwick_MA_01077_M96045-30576","property_id":"9604530576","listing_id":"2979391379","mls":"BSMA","mls_id":"73345676","status":"SOLD","text":"Enjoy all that one-level living has to offer in this BRAND NEW, gorgeous RANCH on Cul-de-Sac Street!
