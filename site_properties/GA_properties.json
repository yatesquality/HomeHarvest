youve been hunting for a nearly Stepless Ranch near Lake Lanier with an Open Floorplan, beautiful Primary Bathroom, fantastic Back Porch overlooking a Spacious, Private, Fenced Backyard, all tucked at the end of a cul-de-sac Buckle. Up. The Home is anchored right in the center by the Open Living-Kitchen-Breakfast Space. Youll love being able to use the Kitchen without being shut off from the rest of the party. Granite Countertops, Stainless Steel Appliances, and plenty of Cabinet Space further upgrade your experience. | The Split-Bedroom Plan puts the Secondary Bedrooms & Hall Bath on the opposite end of the home from the Primary Suite. The Primary Suite is really more of a Retreat, thanks to the tastefully Updated Master Bath.

Youll never have a rock punch a hole in your Vinyl Siding, because THERE ISNT ANY Cement Siding all the way! Youve likely never been on a Acre Lot that feels this spacious. Outside the Vast (and beautifully Stained) 6 Privacy Fence is a well-built Shed (yes, the area up there is yours too), a Gardening Space, and Extra Parking Spot. Your Property Lines extend into the Woods as well. An enormous amount of effort went into creating a Backyard that could only be described as featuring a 4-Phase Shindig System. Hosting will be your new jam, and Phase 1 begins in the Lower Tier of the Backyard by the Basement Door. There youll find a Trampoline, Sand Box, and flat area perfect for a game of Spike Ball. The kids will love this spot, while adults will have plenty of room for Yard Games on the Upper Tier of the Yard (Phase 2 right there). Phase 3 kicks off as evening rolls around and you have Dinner on the Back Deck. When the sun clocks out, Phase 4 will be in full swing as you move into the Screened Back Porch and toast marshmallows around a Firepit just promise youll invite ME.

prepared to be captivated by this lakeside beauty in Lamplighter Cove, recently renovated and priced THOUSANDS BELOW APPRAISAL! It's chock-full of personality, charm, and character. In addition to 3 generous and enticing levels, it delights with nooks and crannies. It's in tiptop condition, continuously improved and affectionately maintained with great attention to quality and detail. Most every room provides a lovely lake view, and the aluminum, double slip, party deck dock with deep water access is a short, gentle walk away. Every level allows you to step out onto a covered porch, deck, or balcony to relish the view, and the new windows across the picturesque sunporch make that space especially inviting. There is a comfortable, family room on every level, each featuring a stone fireplace. The remodeled owner's suite on the main offers a custom wardrobe, accent wall with a beautiful built-in, and new glass doors to the lakeside deck. The upgraded bath features a double vanity with custom cabinetry, new mirrors, fixtures, glass shower doors, and a specialty free-standing tub with oil rubbed bronze claw feet. The second level was redesigned to add a second owner's suite with a lakeside balcony, a bath offering fashionable cabinetry, high-end fixtures, a huge walk-in shower, and large soaking tub. This suite also boasts its own winsome loft. The oh-so-pretty kitchen was upgraded in 2023 with new custom cabinetry, lighting, top-of-the-line fixtures, GE cafe appliances, soft close drawers and doors, quartz countertops, a farmhouse sink, and a large free-standing island. A drive around back reveals a second, 2 car garage\/workshop. The architectural roof, gutter guards, and HVAC are less than 5 years old, as is the beautiful circular driveway. There are so many new and upgraded features in this extraordinary home it's impossible to enumerate them all here. The only thing capable of luring the owners away from this home they love and have made exceptional is the opportunity to be close to twin grandchildren. You must see this one, so close to River Forks Park, Pelican Pete's and Skogies.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"3680 Lamplighter Cove Rd","street":"3680 Lamplighter Cove

brand-new home is finished with easy occupancy for an immediate sale client. At this time, we could easily be available to close within the next two weeks. This model is a custom modified Frank Betz-designed Gulfport House Plan - The Gulfport is the perfect blend of classic exterior style and modern interior amenities. The steep pitched main roof and low-slung porches dictate the elevation. Standing seam metal roofing front porch & lifetime limited warranty architectural shingled roof, along with traditional clapboard (some board & batten) siding are the materials of choice that create a classic low-country design. Wide porches on both front and rear will catch cooling breezes and provide the favorite location for a conversation or a good book. The main level is anchored by a huge grand room and open kitchen. The grand room has a huge oversized warming fireplace and potential for built-in shelve or cabinetry on both sides. The kitchen has a large island with farmhouse sink and breakfast bar. The huge front & rear porches add living space to enjoy fair weather. The master suite has a wooded-tray ceiling and is fitted with 2-tall exit doorways to a huge 8' deep side-deck with wide year-round lake views. The master bath features a huge walk-in dual-headed all-tile shower. The mudroom entry is the perfect place for coats, shoes and book bags. There are 4 total potential laundry rooms, with 1 finished on the main level (with scrub sink) and 1 finished on the 2nd level up, and a 3rd stubbed out for the unfinished bonus room suite with a 4th stub in the basement. The kitchen also offers side by side refrigerator & upscale appliances. The massive back deck includes a separate covered porch with plumbing & electrical stub-out covered outdoor kitchen. The back deck also features steps to a lower-level unfinished basement (also stubbed for a full bath and 3rd kitchen area). The upper level has three additional bedrooms each with access to a bathroom and oversized closet space. There are also large doored-access storage areas off some of the BR spaces. The optionally finished bonus room has a private stairway plus upper-level hallway access and has many uses for its new owners to decide. This bonus area is being plumbing stubbed for a 3rd laundry area and full bath potential. This home offers great views of Lake Lanier from two separate unique vantage points (both front & left side) due to the elevated positioning on this beautiful waterfront lot. The side entry 3-car garage has oversized doors (8' x 18' and 8' x 9') with an added turn-out (engineered and reinforced) retaining wall that will be very accommodating. A convenient pet\/scrub sink is also installed in the middle back wall of the garage, and convenient grocery bin access can be offered into the kitchen pantry back wall directly from the garage. Nearby expansion of schools and hospitals make this area very desirable for very convenient suburban living. Capture this rare opportunity for new construction on Lake Lanier. Lakefront lots are now becoming very scarce.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"3176 Gulls Wharf Dr","street":"3176 Gulls Wharf

you go to view this house make sure to drive through the eclectic, old growth neighborhood and see the variety of beautiful homes, including those million dollar plus lake front homes at the end of the cul de sac. It is an absolutely gorgeous area filled with great parks like Roper, Wessel and Wilshire, some within walking distance. The setting of the house is equally lovely, sitting on its third of an acre, gently sloping lot which backs up to over 30 acres of huge hardwoods, which in turn connect to the beautiful 70-acre Linwood Nature Preserve. The house itself is an all brick rambler sporting a cute, tiled front porch entryway through the great room or use the entrance through the kitchen off the two-car carport. With hardwood floors throughout, there are 3 ample bedrooms on the first floor, with a unique 1.5-bathroom, jack and jill set up so that the master has its own half bath with direct access to the shower, and another half bath off the main hall. The remodeled kitchen is spacious with a main sink and separate prep sink and loads of counter space between. There is an attached dining area or pull up some stools to the breakfast bar. The main lounge is also in the great room with the kitchen. Off the kitchen is a garden room with French doors for some privacy if desired, which also has an exit onto a covered back porch. Downstairs is a finished mother in law suite with a large sitting area, bedroom area and bath, having its own entrance for privacy.

The owners have expanded the square footage at the back of the home, allowing for larger secondary bedrooms. The primary suite has been tailored for accessibility, featuring widened doorways for wheelchair access if needed, a custom closet system, and a spa-like stand-up shower with bench. Upstairs you will find a bedroom and full bath as well as ample walk-in attic storage. Embrace the beauty of outdoor living on the screened porch with a cozy fireplace and durable Eze-Breeze windows to create an all season room-perfect for year-round comfort. The property also boasts an extended stone patio, a fenced level yard, and a spacious three-car garage with additional storage space. The irrigation system ensures you can keep your yard lush and green. Located just a golf cart ride away from Pelican Pete's, you'll enjoy live music and casual dining in style. Spend your days embracing the lakeside lifestyle-whether cruising on your boat at sunset or enjoying a relaxing evening at home.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"8865 Port View

Thoughtfully renovated, 5562 Hidden Harbor Landing offers the perfect blend of modern comforts and tranquil lakeside living in an extremely convenient location. This Gainesville address sits on the edge of downtown Flowery Branch and is just a few minutes from adorable shops and restaurants, retail shopping, Alberta Banks Park, I-985, about an hour from Atlanta International Airport, and just 15 minutes from Lee Gilmer Memorial Airport in Gainesville. You'll love the warmth the extra wide plank pine floors bring to the sun soaked living room with vaulted ceilings. The cozy, brick fireplace makes it the perfect place to gather to enjoy lake life during the cold months too. The entire back side of the house is lined with oversized picture windows to admire the peaceful Lake Lanier views. The recently remodeled kitchen boasts sleek quartz countertops, brand new stainless steel appliances including a double oven range, floating shelves with accent lighting, and a spacious pantry. A rope light fixture adds the perfect nautical feel to the connected dining space. Retreat to the newly carpeted primary suite, complete with an ensuite bathroom with all of the features you've always wanted! The delightful heated floors, Bluetooth speakers, automated lights, dual vanities, and spacious tile shower are all recent upgrades. Opposite the primary suite is another spacious bedroom with full bath attached. The retro green tile is perfectly paired with lake worthy wallpaper reminding you of all of the fun there is to have boating at the lake! This bedroom has a spacious walk-in closet as well. There is more fun to be had downstairs in the well-lit terrace level! Plenty of room for recreation, there is also a custom bar with a hand painted mural. The 3rd bedroom is just off the main space with its own fully tiled bathroom. The laundry room has plenty of storage for washing and hanging wet suits. Every lake home needs plenty of storage for lake toys, fishing rods, and tools! This one has 769 sq ft of storage in the mechanical room and attached workshop area. The upstairs deck overlooks the water, of course, and is perfect for entertaining al fresco! Stairs lead to the tiled patio below, a quaint swing, and hot tub area. If you know Lake Lanier, you know how coveted a covered double slip dock is! The gentle 40 step walk down to the water provides easy access to boating, fishing, and all the water sports you can handle. Spend your days on the water and your evenings admiring the 110' shoreline. The owners reinforced the shore with new rip rap and the boat lift is ready to make protecting your boat easier.

From the moment you drive up to the property you'll note the exceptional details this home offers including beautiful mature landscaping, a level drive to a side entry garage, a covered rocking chair front porch, and a NEW ROOF that was just installed in Nov. 2024. Step through the front door and you'll be greeted by beautiful real hardwood floors that grace the entire main and upper levels with the exception of the tiled baths and carpeted upper bedrooms, a wall of windows that bring the wooded views into the great room, and a warm and inviting stone fireplace with a raised stone hearth. This roomy floorplan offers a blend of open and functional spaces with an owner's suite on the main level, a large kitchen with an open view to the great room, front and rear stairways, three additional spacious upstairs bedrooms, and a full unfinished basement ready for your dream expansion project. Outdoors you'll find two roomy decks (one rear deck and one side deck) plus a large screen porch all which offer relaxing views of the wooded surroundings. In the winter months you'll even catch a view of Lake Lanier and the North Georgia Mountains from your side deck and upper level windows! A nice sized area is fenced, but there's plenty of room to expand the grassed area in back or keep the wooded private area of this 0.68 acre lot. The Ridgewater on Lanier Subdivision offers a wonderful lifestyle with the perfect blend of approximately 70 on-lake and off-lake properties, a community pool, tennis court, and community dock for lake access (no slips). It's a quick ride to a nice mix of convenient shopping, restaurants, entertainment venues, and the new medical center located along GA400. And for those fun weekends load up the lake toys; Toto Creek Boat Ramp and Park is only 2 miles away!
