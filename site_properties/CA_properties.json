You enter into a cozy living room with a rock fireplace surrounded by a wall of shelves. On the right is a galley kitchen with all the appliances included. Toward the back is a great bonus room perfect for a home office or greenhouse. Next is a huge deck that was professionally built. It's solid! The previous owner spent over $70, 000 building the decks and reinforcing the foundation. Down a flight of exterior stairs you will find the laundry room equipped with GE washer \/dryer, next is a large room and bathroom that could be converted to a studio apartment, craft room, home office, man cave or what ever your housing needs require. Plus, a concrete driveway for 2 car parking.

one story Heltzer home on a beautiful cul-de-sac, with mature trees, nestled on a park-like setting in a prime West Hills neighborhood. Close to Orcutt Ranch, local parks and great schools. The large entry foyer, with custom built Oak front door and original hardwood floors, opens up to the large family room with stone fireplace, crown moldings and a sliding glass door that overlooks the private backyard. The pass through with Quartz countertops is convenient for work at home, easy countertop dining, and opens up the floor plan. The sliding glass doors in the family and dining rooms flood the home with natural light. The dining room is cozy enough for your weekly dinners, yet large enough for every holiday gathering. The kitchen features recently installed Quartz countertops, under mount stainless steel sink, faucet and luxury vinyl plank flooring, also installed throughout the dining and laundry rooms. Boasting stainless steel appliances, a 5 burner gas cooktop, and double ovens, there is plenty of counter space to spread out. The split floor plan features the primary suite on one side, with the two secondary bedrooms and a roomy additional hallway closet adjacent to the secondary bath, on the other. The spacious master suite features two large windows, ample closet space, and its own bath. The upgraded bathrooms include recently installed custom glass shower doors in both bathrooms, new faucets, medicine cabinets, and a fully tiled secondary shower, which includes a large tub. The indoor laundry room features tons of storage cabinets, with direct access to the two car garage. The climate controlled garage will help cool you off on those hot valley days, or warm you up during the chilly winter months. Sitting at the end of the cul-de-sac, there is plenty of room to play, ride bikes, and entertain in the backyard under the covered patio. A storage shed provides additional storage space for all of your extra holiday decor, yard tools, and gardening supplies. Close to West Hills Hospital, The Village at Topanga, The Commons of Calabasas, and a short drive to Westlake Village or Malibu.

Comfortable living and dining areas are perfectly suited for relaxing time at home or for hosting guests. Continuing on, you'll find the star of the home, a sprawling chef's kitchen, renovated just two years ago, with 33 linear feet of quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, a farmhouse sink, beverage refrigerator, and organizer pullouts. With ample space to store all cookware, dinnerware, and appliances, you can enjoy long, open counters for food prep and dedicated space for a coffee or cocktail bar. Upstairs you'll also find a bright bedroom, a remodeled three-quarter bathroom, and a large hall pantry for additional storage. Moving downstairs are two additional bedrooms, another remodeled full bathroom, and a two-car garage with direct access. Exiting outside, you'll find a refreshing private yard with a brick patio and fresh landscaping, perfect for indoor\/outdoor living and entertaining. In addition to the aforementioned upgrades, the roof was redone in 2021.

Some upgrades that have been done to the home include a new roof (with a 30 year warranty), all copper plumbing, a new dishwasher and garbage disposal, and a drip system in the front yard. The location of the home is hard to beat. It is just a short distance to the main pond where you can fish and picnic, a playground, basketball courts, tennis courts, one of the three pools and hot tub, citrus trees to pick from, and community library. Going the opposite way, is another pool, more playgrounds, more basketball courts, a volleyball court, and a dog park. You'll have a plethora of amenities to choose from!

property is lake frontage, with deeded access to boat ramp, sun deck and dock access, and a house that needs to be torn down. The boat ramp, sun deck, and dock are shared with three adjoining parcels. The septic system is not functioning. The power has been disconnected per order of Lake County Code Enforcement. The water source is from the lake, and substantial investment in water treatment equipment is needed. It has been red tagged by the county, and no one is allowed entry into the home and its current condition. Rebuilding will be a challenge: it is in an area that previously had slides, its on a dirt road and you need to walk to it. Do not try to find it without your agent with you. The views are gorgeous, and all of the value is in the land. The value has been set by an appraisal. This property's cove location provides protection from the wind and choppy waters. Due to its condition, this property is cash only. Fire risk is very high. None of the appliances work and there has been substantial vandalism. The fireplace is not safe to use. The deck is not safe to walk on at all.

the pinnacle of luxurious ocean-view living at this distinctive townhome in Huntington Beach. Crafted by award-winning Christopher Homes, the three-level turnkey residence frames Pacific Ocean, sunset and city-light panoramas from its coveted upper-perimeter location in The Villas at the exclusive gate-guarded enclave of Pacific Shores. Overlooking natural wetlands, the home reveals its outstanding interaction with outdoor living spaces by welcoming visitors with a covered front patio. Indoors, main living areas open to a private courtyard that easily caters to memorable entertaining. An ambiance of warm transitional elegance awaits in a great room that displays a fireplace flanked by custom built-ins, and a dining room that is destined to be the setting for fun-filled meals. Open to both rooms, the kitchen is as functional as it is impressive, with handsome mocha-stained Shaker cabinetry featuring glass uppers, and an oversized island with seating on two sides. Quartz countertops, a full tile backsplash, and a butlers pantry with wine refrigerator and walk-in pantry are joined by a suite of KitchenAid appliances that includes a built-in refrigerator and a six-burner range with griddle and two ovens. Generously sized at approximately 3, 604 square feet, this sophisticated design reveals four ensuite bedrooms and four- and one-half baths, including a secondary suite with ocean-view Juliet balcony, and a loft-style third-floor bedroom that is ideal as a media or game room. Ocean views are also enjoyed in a sumptuous primary suite that features a covered balcony, walk-in closet, two sinks, sit-down vanity, soaking tub and separate shower. Every detail of the home exudes timeless elegance, including wide-plank white-oak flooring throughout, a light color palette, powder room pedestal sink, extensive built-in cabinetry, and custom crown molding throughout. An attached three-car garage and distinctive European-influenced architecture set this villa apart from traditional townhomes. There are no Mello-Roos fees at Pacific Shores, which hosts a private resort pool, and a park at the entrance with playgrounds, picnic tables and half-court basketball. The beach is less than one-half mile from home, and Huntington Beachs pier, Pacific City, schools and parks are minutes away.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"8178 Noelle

you enter the home you are immediately welcomed by an inviting bright living room with wood floors throughout, a radiant bay window, and a charming fireplace. As you move to the right you enter a spacious dining room with a garden window and just past that is the open kitchen with induction stove, ample cabinets space for storage, and room for some guests to gather. The flow of these spaces makes for a perfect place to entertain family and friends alike. Heading towards the back of the house you pass the laundry closet and enter the family room. A great place for a play room, gaming room, or that quiet reading nook you have always wanted. The fenced off driveway makes the backyard a great place to enjoy the southern California weather. There is space to grill, to have multiple seating areas, for kids to play, or friend to relax by a fire pit. All of this a block from the Chandler Bike path.
