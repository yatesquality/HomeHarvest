What may look like an ordinary house from the front, is anything but ordinary - it has a secret...or two... At the end of its driveway you will find the unassuming two story home. The exterior is what you would expect: well built with covered parking and a welcoming entry lanai that is surrounded by attractive tropical landscaping. Step inside and you will know this is no ordinary home: you will be immediately greeted by the double height soaring ceilings. Taking it all in, it just gets better. The spacious eat-in kitchen anchors the center of the home on the ground floor, while the lower level bedrooms and bathrooms are situated at the far ends of the house. The primary suite is a treat for the homeowner or that special guest - large, lots of natural light, and a custom ensuite bathroom. The second ground-floor bedroom is no slouch either: large, well lit, and well-appointed. Bedrooms three and four on the upper level are at opposite ends of the home - perfect for privacy and views of HIlo town to Hilo Bay and the Pacific Ocean beyond. The best parts are still to come, including the secrets... The ocean side of the home has a long covered lanai from which you can enjoy morning coffee or look down to the... miniature golf style putting green. Fun! And then there is the real secret. The real secret is the Retreat: a covered, open-air room built just above the babbling brook that flows through the backyard. That's right, the backyard has a freshwater stream. The back of the home is a true sanctuary: small waterfalls, lava rock pools, tropical plants, koi, guppies, and opae 'ai (crawfish or crayfish). The tranquility and privacy are preserved by the beautiful lava rock walls - the perfect backdrop for this true Hawaii naturescape. Did we mention the property has a solar\/photovoltaic system for affordable, sustainable electric power? Hilo has few properties like this, and rarely do they become available.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"726 Waianuenue Ave Apt A","street":"726 Waianuenue Ave","unit":"Apt

your dream home on this rare half-acre lot with mature landscaping and lush green grass, located about a block from the scenic Hilo Municipal Golf Course. Nestled in a neighborhood that's rarely available, this cleared and ready-to-build property offers a unique opportunity in a prime location. The lot previously hosted a two-story home built in 1973, which has since been removed leaving behind a substantial cement slab that may offer potential use as a future home pad (buyer to confirm with county). An existing foundation footprint and level terrain saves you time and resources in site prep. Prior home had gorgeous scenic views from the second floor! This lot is situated in front of a flag lot with its own private driveway, offering enhanced privacy and direct road access. Conveniently located close to schools, shopping and entertainment.

Gorgeous lanai is a perfect place to entertain your family and friends. The unit sits in Wailuku Park Townhouses, far enough from the road. Yet just a stone's throw away, the town lives - schools, shops, and morning coffee within easy reach, like old friends waiting just around the bend. From here the land spills down into a green hush of rainforest on one side, and to the blue ocean on the other. The private parking spot just where you want it - no uphill battles, no long walks. The sense of privacy is rare: a tucked - away feeling. The HOA dues are simple and sturdy - they cover the bones and breath of the place: water, gas, garbage, insurance, the water heater, the steady hand of an on-site manager. It's a home that minds its own business and takes care of yours, too. This isn't just a unit. It's a pause from the world, a place where the land and sea meet and wait for you to notice.","style":"CONDOS","full_street_line":"188 Hale St Apt 3C","street":"188 Hale St","unit":"Apt 3C","city":"Hilo","state":"HI","zip_code":"96720","beds":3,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":null,"sqft":1055,"year_built":1973,"days_on_mls":31,"list_price":420000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-04-18","sold_price":null,"last_sold_date":null,"assessed_value":null,"estimated_value":null,"tax":null,"tax_history":null,"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":null,"price_per_sqft":398,"latitude":19.72036,"longitude":-155.098618,"neighborhoods":"Hilo Town, South Hilo","county":"Hawaii","fips_code":"15001","stories":null,"hoa_fee":550,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"523887","agent_name":"Jared C.

This 9.95 acre parcel on Laula Rd gives you the comfort and privacy of being on a dead-end road on the outskirts of town yet easily connected to the conveniences of living in Hilo. Just a half mile away is the Hilo Municipal Golf Course, as well as Firestation 3 located on Haihai St. This prime location in the Waiakea Homesteads area means that you are about 3 miles away from Target, Walmart, and the Prince Kuhio Shopping Center area, as well as the Waiakea School Complex. Meanwhile, getting to downtown Hilo is about 5 miles and 7 miles to the beautiful beach parks of the Keaukaha. With nearly 10 acres of AG-3 zoned land, this property offers a variety of potential for future applications. You have options whether planning on building a grand estate for yourself, subdividing into 3 smaller parcels, or capitalizing on the rich agriculture potential. At present, the property is covered by lush tropical jungle and features a 16ft x 16ft unpermitted storage shed. Selectively landscaping the property could produce mountain views that are currently hidden. Although it has since overgrown, the property has 2500 sqft crushed rock driveway layered over a geotextile fabric. To get a better feel for the scope of the property, be sure to see the Video Tour in the listing. HELCO overhead electric power is available to the property, and there is an active County Water meter already installed. Additionally, there is an easement access for a potential Iwalani St. extension in the future. Should this project materialize, the property would be bisected by the extension thereby creating street front 3 sides. The property is being sold As-Is.

Gorgeous lanai is a perfect place to entertain your family and friends. The unit sits in Wailuku Park Townhouses, far enough from the road. Yet just a stone's throw away, the town lives - schools, shops, and morning coffee within easy reach, like old friends waiting just around the bend. From here the land spills down into a green hush of rainforest on one side, and to the blue ocean on the other. The private parking spot just where you want it - no uphill battles, no long walks. The sense of privacy is rare: a tucked - away feeling. The HOA dues are simple and sturdy - they cover the bones and breath of the place: water, gas, garbage, insurance, the water heater, the steady hand of an on-site manager. It's a home that minds its own business and takes care of yours, too. This isn't just a unit. It's a pause from the world, a place where the land and sea meet and wait for you to notice.","style":"CONDOS","full_street_line":"188 Hale St Apt 3C","street":"188 Hale St","unit":"Apt 3C","city":"Hilo","state":"HI","zip_code":"96720","beds":3,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":null,"sqft":1055,"year_built":1973,"days_on_mls":31,"list_price":420000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-04-18","sold_price":null,"last_sold_date":null,"assessed_value":null,"estimated_value":null,"tax":null,"tax_history":null,"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":null,"price_per_sqft":398,"latitude":19.72036,"longitude":-155.098618,"neighborhoods":"Hilo Town, South Hilo","county":"Hawaii","fips_code":"15001","stories":null,"hoa_fee":550,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"523887","agent_name":"Jared C.
