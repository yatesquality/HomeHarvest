The primary bedroom has a large walk-in closet, and the primary bath has a deep soaking tub. Completely renovated by current owners since they purchased it in 2018. Improvements include new roof (2018), electric, plumbing, new septic and leach field in 2018, 6 new natural gas wall heaters (all on thermostats), and much more. An attached carport houses one car, but there is plenty of room on the property for many vehicles. Large (637 sf) deluxe chicken coop and screened outdoor run is attached to a large shed which would work for a workshop or studio.

The property consists of two adjacent 20-acre parcels with a 16x16 ft custom-built tiny home , artistically crafted from local rocks...each hand picked and placed by the builder. The tiny home has a metal roof with gutters to collect rain water. Power is provided by solar panels and a small wind turbine (both likely in need of repair and upgrading). There is a domestic well with solar pump, an outside bath with shower and cow-tank soaking tub, but a septic system is needed. As shown in the photos, there are abundant building materials remaining on the property that convey with the sale: large red bricks, heavy lumber, steel roof tresses, ceramic red-tile shingles, fire bricks, windows and more. There is an approx. 28-foot vintage single-wide travel trailer mounted on blocks that has been used as a guest quarters , but could be converted to office space or storage. The property is located along the western edge of the San Simon River bed (dry most of the year) with stunning views of the nearby Peloncillo Mountains to the east and Cave Creek Canyon in the Chiricahua Mountainsa a few miles to the west. The property has a spiritual feeling to it since the area was once occupied by ancient native American peoples. Vegetation consists of mainly of yucca, creosote, and some cacti. The land is not in an HOA and there are no CCRs. The property is totally private and situated at the end of a gravel road; however, the sister communities of Rodeo, NM and Portal AZ are conveniently located just minutes away.
