work has been done, just move in! Spectacular recent interior renovation by Leigh Overland Architects with Interior design by Lisa Mason of Inspirations For Your Home, LLC.

Gleaming newer hardwood flooring almost everywhere. All new kitchen with large center island, wide open to large dining room with sunny bay window, and the cozy living room with fireplace and beams. Three remodeled tiled full bathrooms with (HEATED!) tile floors, and a convenient half bath in lower level that could be changed to a full if needed because there is ample space in lower level for all kinds of ideas. Stunning large sunroom addition about 6 years ago with tiled floor and glass roof. Pretty & private yard with fenced gardens and natural stone walls, unobstructed wooded views, and wonderful bird watching. Walk-out lower level features lots of windows & custom sliders to back patio; in-law, office and\/or gym space potential. Separate lower level \/ basement workshop area with it's own door to back yard. Oversized 2-car garage with huge attic above it via pull-down stairs. Walking distance to lovely West Lake Reservoir, around 7 minutes to shopping & dining on popular Mill Plain Rd. Well maintained home. Not on market for over 40 years, only 2 owners ever, no expense spared, rare opportunity, don't miss this home! Don't miss the HEATED BATHROOM FLOORS! What a lovely feature in the winter and all chilly mornings! Also: Popcorn ceilings removed, recessed lights, closets & window seats added.

A storage shed sits at the back of the property & just beyond is lightly wooded privacy that abuts to town of Middlebury land. A quaint enclave of roads makes for a family friendly neighborhood but still close to shopping, restaurants, & the highway. Middlebury is part of award winning Region 15 schools & home to Lake Quassapaug Amusement Park. Middlebury Recreation Area (MRA) offers seasonal passes to the lake for residents only.

one you've been waiting for is here! This COVENTRY LAKE home with 6 rooms is in the Waterfront Heights Lake Association and has had many recent upgrades including a remodeled full bath featuring a good-sized walk-in shower with glass door. A new floor in the kitchen gives this room a fresh clean look. Many rooms throughout this home were recently painted. The flexible floor plan could accommodate a first floor bedroom. The new brick chimney is less than 2 years old. In 2020, a new 1000 gallon septic tank was installed. Last year gutters were added to the house and garage. Two more features that buyers will appreciate are the detached garage, with upgraded electrical, full size basement and the large deck off the kitchen which overlook the level back yard. In addition to these improvements, this home's location is a true bonus. As a member of the Waterfront Heights Lake Association, you have access to the private beach association which has a private parking lot, park with volleyball court and several picnic tables and grills and of course a large sandy beach. Members can moor boats, space permitting, canoe and kayaks can be stored at the beach for members convenience. 2645 Main Street is just a few miles from UCONN, 20 minutes to Hartford and 30 Minutes to

AND FINAL OFFERS ARE DUE BY 5PM ON FRIDAY, APRIL 25. This sweet ranch is the perfect starter home or downsizing opportunity. Located in the Morley elementary district, you're close to shopping and dining in both the Center and Bishops Corner. Inside, you'll love all of the natural sunlight in the open living and dining rooms, as both have large picture windows. A gas burning fireplace with built-ins and hardwood floors add to the charm. A heated sunroom is off the dining room. It overlooks the backyard and connects to the attached garage. The kitchen has plenty of work and storage space. It also houses the laundry area. There are two nicely sized bedrooms, a full bathroom, and a powder room. Outside, there is a spacious rear deck for entertaining. The yard is partially fenced and there is a storage shed. You'll appreciate plenty of storage space in the unfinished basement and floored, walk-up attic. This well maintained home offers a new oil boiler, newer roof, replacement windows, vinyl siding, and newer oil tank.

SUBMIT OFFERS BY 5 PM MONDAY 3\/10\/25. There's so much more here than meets the eye! The modest exterior of the home at 10 Colony Road hides a very cheery, light filled home that is a true gem. Seemingly a one-story home from the street, it is two stories in the back, with a fully finished 1600 sq ft walkout level complete with a family room & fireplace, 2 bedrooms, workout, office, and laundry room. Sunshine streams into the back of the house with its southern exposure, flooding the main floor kitchen, LR, primary bedroom and naturally, the lower level. You'll enjoy whipping up a gourmet meal in the sun-drenched kitchen - shake up your evening cocktail at the wet bar and retreat with a juicy novel to the LR. Later, relax in the soaking tub in the primary bathroom complete with 2 walk in closets and lots of natural light. Step outside the FR onto the expansive deck & entertain to your hearts content! Organize bocce ball &\/or croquet across the manicured lawn. Your four-legged friends will be in doggie heaven, romping across the fenced-in backyard with in-ground irrigation system. Colony Rd has the trifecta of town utilities - city water, sewer & natural gas.

This ready-to-rent two-family turnkey property could easily be converted back into a single-family home. This house is in top-notch condition and sits on a quiet side street of well-kept, house-proud homes and just a short walk to Thomaston center for shopping, dining and local amenties. Easy access to the highway offers great mobility for commuting and travel. If you love nature, there are beautiful wooded trails to explore right behind the house. Tucked in on a pretty street off the rural highway, you get the best of both worlds- privacy and convenience. The large level yard offers plenty of room for family entertainment, play and gardening. The garage, storage shed, and paved driveway make everyday living easy. The home backs up to quiet town-owned woods for extra peace and privacy. Inside, it's move-in ready: freshly painted, new carpet upstairs, gorgeous hardwood floors, and two super clean full baths (one on each level)! Each floor has a spacious kitchen and sunny porch, two large bedrooms, and a living room. Downstairs has a large pantry, and upstairs has a mudroom. Both have their own laundry, which is a total game changer. So much to love about this place! Listing it all is one thing, seeing it is another. Come see for yourself! Homes like this in such a prime, desirable location don't last long. The tax record says the property is 1.1 acres, and it has been staked. This is an incredible opportunity. This house is turnkey.

There are hardwood floors through out and updated vinyl windows. The condition of the pool is unknown, it hasn't been open in about 5 years but functioned perfectly and was properly winterized back then. **Also, please note - the entirety of the driveway is not on the property. It's located on a town 'paper road' that was originally planned to extend to Mayweed although was never put in. The town has no plans to do anything with it but please do your own research. The three new builds directly in back also have driveways that extend through the same 'paper road'. Our property ends at the telephone pole in front yard. The sale of the house is strictly 'AS IS'.

A tree-lined, sweeping gravel drive leads to this perfectly situated home featuring light-filled rooms and blonde, white oak floors throughout. The beautifully designed kitchen includes pristine white cabinetry, honed black granite counters, and a dining area perfectly situated in front of three sets of sliding doors to the bluestone terrace. The family room features a modern wood-burning stove and French doors to the sunroom with walls of windows overlooking the flowering field. A room at the front of the house with French doors offers a more private living space that can serve as a home office, den, or formal dining room. Upstairs is the perfectly sized primary bedroom with walk-in closet and en-suite bath with a soaking tub. Three more bedrooms and a full hall bath share this level. A large unfinished space accessed through one of the bedrooms offers storage or potential for more finished space - possibly a home gym or studio. The nature-filled and private property offers over 9 acres with walking trails through and around the gorgeous flowering field leading to the pond.
