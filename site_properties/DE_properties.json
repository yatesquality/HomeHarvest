With 3, 100 sqft of indoor living-space, there's both ample room to relax and enjoy family time, or host guests for a fun evening or extended-stay. Spanning 4-bedrooms and 3-bathrooms, with a primary suite fit for luxury, the elegantly-styled design flows over two levels, in addition to the fully-floored attic, offering plenty of storage, custom window-blinds, and even a crank in order to lower the stately foyer-chandelier for cleaning. Moving down to the kitchen, one finds a well-stocked area for preparing fine meals, with stainless-steel appliances and a two-level island, including a lower ledge for dining. From there, the open concept and hardwood-flooring journeys by the formal dining area and to the living room, where the noble fireplace acts as a centerpiece and coziness-provider during the chilly nights. Easy access through the door brings in a whole other element to the property: the oasis-like outdoor space. Boasting over 1.5 acres, there's no shortage of things to do and see. Beginning with the grand, covered back-porch, which flows onto the deck, relaxing or entertaining at any time of the day is seamless; there's even a hot tub hookup to boot. Gardeners have hit the jackpot, as a short stroll finds a custom-built greenhouse, along with raised garden-beds within and on the exterior. An enclosed fence offers extra security for children and pets, but beyond that features scenic nature trails that wind through the woods to a tranquil creek, which eventually empties into the Nanticoke River. Around to the front of the house, the views are equally-impressive, where the fully-landscaped yard, irrigation system, and solar lights amplify the already-stunning curb appeal. The paved driveway easily fits 5 cars, along with 2 spaces in the side garage, where an outlooking window accepts sun into the bonus room above, accessed inside by a second staircase. There are myriad additional features, including a convenient laundry chute to make household tasks easier; 2 HVAC systems, with the lower being replaced In April 2024; Tankless water heater replaced March 2025; a transferrable leaf-filter gutter-protection system from 2022; pumping of the septic system in October 2023; the refrigerator with water and ice was replaced in 2023; and apart from a few minor exclusions, the home comes fully-furnished.

Solidly built, it does need updates, but it offers tremendous potential. Three bedrooms upstairs with a full bath and enhanced by a lower level family room that could be a fourth bedroom with an adjoining full bath. Yes, that's 2 full baths plus a powder room on the first floor. The main entrance opens to the living room with adjoining dining area and kitchen and then leads to the family room at the back of the house. In the family room, you'll enjoy the wood burning fireplace and the fact that the room is flooded with light (large windows) and leads to the deck, which overlooks the open space behind the townhome. Whew! Lots of great things there! There is also a side entrance to the property which provides access to the lower level, but there is also a sliding glass door at the back of the lower level family room. Yes, it needs work, but with the right touches, this can be a dream townhome. Cash and fix-up financing only for this one.

MISS the ATTACHED VIDEO OF THIS PROPERTY! Click the video button to view video! Enjoy this rare opportunity to own almost 7 acres on Haven Lake! The serenity of this secluded 6.8 acre parcel off the Williamsville Road in Milford, (Kent County) Delaware is Spectacular! This 6.8 acre property has been vacant since the 1960s with many natural features including waterfront direct lake access for kayaks, canoes, standup paddleboards, sailing, fishing and waterskiing with a floating dock at the property on the waterfront. Hike through lush deciduous and Atlantic White Cedar woodlands and other native species of trees and plants. Spot many native reptiles, amphibians, mammals, waterfowl and birds from the lake front! An old spring-fed fish pond from past times is still visible. This property requires both well and septic. Although the parcel is located both in X the AE flood zone, there is more than ample room to build a home (or several!). Haven Lake is not tidal, and a spring fed body of water. A Subdivision of this property may be possible through Kent County.","style":"LAND","full_street_line":"Williamsville Rd","street":"Williamsville
