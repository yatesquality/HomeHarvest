this home of yesterday a home or investment for tomorrow. This two-bedroom, one-bath bungalow just outside the core city has great curb appeal. Inside, youll find tall ceilings, wood floors, and craftsman-style trim. Theres a two-vehicle detached garage, and a 10 x 7 metal storage shed too. Sitting on two lots, this home currently has plenty of space between you and the neighbors. You could even pursue the opportunity of separating the property into two lots again and maybe adding a second home? The home needs some updating, so you can decide to remodel, add to, or remove the old and build something new.

CHOICE! Here we have not one, but two 50 acre pieces of outdoor enthusiast heaven located in Otoe County, NE. First buyer gets their choice of the North piece, the South piece, or both! Each piece is listed at $375, 000, or the entire 100 acres for $750, 000. From an income perspective the North piece has roughly 19 acres of expired CRP (tillable, ) and the South piece has roughly 12 acres. Those acres could be farmed immediately, or each entire 50 acre parcel could be grazed with an addition of a line fence to separate, if bought by 2 different owners. From a recreational perspective the habitat and hunting potential is OUTSTANDING on each piece. The trail riding, hiking, and camping potential are very comparable, and VERY GOOD on both. The current 100 acre parcel can be split in half to create the opportunity of an affordable getaway, roughly 24 miles from Lincoln and 45 from Omaha.

charming Midtown home youve been dreaming of - the one with character, comfort, and a garden oasis - has just become a reality. This classic 1-story gem has been lovingly cared for and thoughtfully updated by longtime owners. Original hardwood floors throughout the main level lead you to a fully remodeled, modern kitchen (2022). Full baths on both the main and upper levels provide flexibility to suit your lifestyle. The lower level underwent a high-end renovation in 2023, featuring an impressive laundry room that might make chores fun again. Step outside to your own private sanctuary: a lush backyard filled with over 20 species of edible and ornamental plants and trees, floating decks (2023), a greenhouse, and a newly added front shed (2024). Its outdoor living at its most magical, and most practical. With an original brick exterior, updated roof, and composite siding (2016), this home is as durable as it is delightful. This pre-inspected haven is ready to welcome you home.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"5439 Seward St","street":"5439 Seward St","unit":null,"city":"Omaha","state":"NE","zip_code":"68104","beds":3,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":null,"sqft":1888,"year_built":1949,"days_on_mls":28,"list_price":320000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-04-10","sold_price":343000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-08","assessed_value":301200,"estimated_value":326966,"tax":4979,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":4979,"assessment":{"building":262400,"land":38800,"total":301200}},{"year":2023,"tax":5578,"assessment":{"building":225600,"land":38800,"total":264400}},{"year":2022,"tax":5643,"assessment":{"building":225600,"land":38800,"total":264400}},{"year":2021,"tax":4226,"assessment":{"building":160900,"land":38800,"total":199700}},{"year":2020,"tax":4275,"assessment":{"building":160900,"land":38800,"total":199700}},{"year":2019,"tax":3592,"assessment":{"building":133800,"land":33500,"total":167300}},{"year":2018,"tax":3036,"assessment":{"building":107700,"land":33500,"total":141200}},{"year":2017,"tax":3051,"assessment":{"building":107700,"land":33500,"total":141200}},{"year":2016,"tax":3641,"assessment":{"building":156500,"land":13200,"total":169700}},{"year":2015,"tax":3388,"assessment":{"building":146300,"land":12300,"total":158600}},{"year":2014,"tax":3357,"assessment":{"building":146300,"land":12300,"total":158600}},{"year":2013,"tax":3384,"assessment":{"building":146300,"land":12300,"total":158600}},{"year":2012,"tax":3335,"assessment":{"building":146300,"land":12300,"total":158600}},{"year":2010,"tax":3329,"assessment":{"building":146300,"land":12300,"total":158600}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":6534,"price_per_sqft":182,"latitude":41.273898,"longitude":-95.999272,"neighborhoods":"North Omaha, Metcalfe -

one is a show stopper. Welcome to this beautifully renovated 3 bedroom home. The main floor is open and inviting with its custom kitchen, dining and living areas. The kitchen was remodeled in 2022 and includes all black stainless Samsung appliances (which will remain with the home), Quartz countertops, low profile farmhouse sink, as well as a custom vent hood. The main level primary suite was also renovated in 2022 to incorporate a spacious en-suite bathroom featuring a soaker tub, custom tile, and Quartz vanity top. Also included in this renovation was the closet and an addition of a sky light adding substantial natural lighting to the closet and vanity areas. The lower level also received some great updates with new flooring and paint in the two bedrooms and bathroom. And because furnishing a new home can feel like a daunting task, most of the main level furnishings are negotiable in the sale.

As you enter the home, there is a small front porch that leads you into the living room with an open concept layout through the dining room, kitchen and back porch. The bedrooms share a Jack and Jill bathroom with an updated shower surround. The enclosed back porch has the washer and dryer hookups with additional room for a freezer or extra storage needs. There is an unfinished basement, and the backyard has a covered patio with landscaping and alley access. The furnace and central air unit were replaced recently. The detached garage is oversized so there is extra workspace as well as storage for a vehicle or boat with an automatic opener. This home has the charm of an old home with high ceilings, wood floors and is move in ready. Legal Description: 0 30 22 Original Town Blk 5 Lot 9 Ainsworth Taxes: $836.44 Address: 130 N.

on the east end of Hay Springs, Nebraska and on the south side of Highway 20, sits the perfect site for your next business venture or dream acreage. This would be the perfect location to build a home just on the East side of town. The property includes a 60x30 metal shop\/office building with city water to the property. There are corrals in place that could be used for livestock, or removed by the Seller. The shop needs some inside cleaning, but there is potential to have an office on the west side of the shop and store inventory in the remaining space. Inside the building, there is a cement floor, and it is plumbed for a bathroom in the office side of the building. To use the building as a commercial business, the inside would need insulated, and the main opening on the east side could be replaced or adjusted to give it a tighter fit, or install a new door that is more secure.
