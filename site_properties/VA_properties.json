home to this fantastic 1499 square foot, 3 bedroom, 2 bath ranch home. On a spacious corner lot in the Skyview school district, this well maintained home offers a flexible floorplan. When you enter this sweet home into the welcoming foyer, to the left is a sunken living room (please watch your step!) with arched doorways, a brick fireplace with built ins, and a gorgeous garden window. Looking forward is the family room (with slider to the backyard) or use it as a formal dining room. The kitchen has lots of cupboards, and another garden window. Between the sunken living room and the kitchen is the dining room with arched doorways, and an enclosed attached greenhouse through french doors! New LVP floors (2023) makes cleaning easy, and the triple pane windows (with transferable warranty) keep your new home quiet & cool. Down the hallway are 3 roomy bedrooms and the 2 baths. The primary bedroom has 2 closets, and another slider to the backyard with fire pit. The interior laundry is through the main bath. The garage has room for storage and parking with 2 doors into the home... one that enters into the interior laundry (which makes it easy to clean up after a full day of getting messy), and another door that enters into the hallway between the bedrooms. It is a smart floorplan that flows well. Sellers had the insulation updated for the home (including the garage) in 2023, and the roof is less than 5 years old! Front & back sprinklers have an app for conveniency. Sewer scope was done 3\/25, and video is available.

With 2144 sq ft of meticulous maintenance, that includes a new electric panel (2023), vinyl windows, rain guard gutters, a whole-home re-pipe (2023), updated bathrooms (2023), central vacuum (2023), replaced main septic line, and new canned lighting was installed in the rec\/game room. The fridge in the garage is diamond-plated and rated for the garage. The fireplaces in the living room and game room are gas & there is a gas hookup on the back porch for summer BBQ's. I love this floorplan with main floor living including the foyer, front-facing kitchen with breakfast nook (be sure to check out the pantry!), formal dining room, stunning wood floors, and a sunken living room (Please watch your step!!). Upstairs you'll find 3 bedrooms & 2 bathrooms. The primary includes the double wardrobes, and a peaceful balcony overlooking the golf course. One of the bedrooms has a Murphy bed that stays with the home. Down the short flight of stairs is the family\/game room (that includes the pool table!!), 1\/2 bath, laundry room with exterior entrance, and the garage. Don't forget to check out the storage under the main home. If you are looking for location and tranquility, this is the home you have been looking for.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"7103 NE Fairway Ave","street":"7103 NE Fairway

bright and inviting home sits on a quiet cul-de-sac, offering plenty of space and thoughtful updates. The main level has an open layout with tall ceilings and a corner office that gets great natural light. The kitchen features new quartz countertops and recently installed stainless steel appliances, including your refrigerator, dishwasher, and microwave. The primary suite has new LVP flooring, and the third bedroom includes 2 closets, making it easy to use as a fourth bedroom if needed. Brand-new carpet was just installed upstairs, while the downstairs has red oak hardwood floors and carpet that was updated 3 years ago. Meticulously cared for! This home has had its roof, exterior and interior paint, furnace, and AC unit all updated three years ago. New gutters were installed at the same time. Wired for surround sound, no HOA, and is just minutes from all your major freeways, grocery stores, and the Portland International Airport.
