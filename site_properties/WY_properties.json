close-in rural, 2.69 acre, tree lined property featuring 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms and a 5 bay garage is just waiting for your finishing touches. This home has all brand new, never used electrical, plumbing, furnace, central A\/C, and tankless water heater. The septic system, well pump, and roof were newly installed in 2021, not to mention a mud room, a large walk-in pantry, a sitting room off the kitchen, a generous sunroom off the primary bedroom, an upstairs loft\/office space, and a large wrap-around patio, perfect for watching the gorgeous Wyoming sunsets. While installing the finishing touches in the house, you can live on the property in the temporarily converted 2 bay, heated garage with a fully functional kitchen, laundry area, full bathroom, living room, and 3 bedrooms. Once construction is done, convert the garage back to the 2 bays with a mezzanine that would be great for an office, workshop, or storage. With a great view of Cheyenne and close access to town, the location is hard to beat. The property also has full electrical, water, and sewer dump hook-ups for your RV or recreational needs.

mountain retreat with guest quarters, forest, and top-of-the-world views! Nestled in a grove of mature aspen, this home provides the get-away experience you've been craving. It blends well with the landscape and, in spite of some excellent views, is hidden from the view of the road and most of the surrounding countryside. The back deck is a birdwatcher's paradise. A detached garage houses a ground-floor apartment, laundry room, and an unfinished loft apartment. The highest elevation on this property stands above the house and provides commanding views of the Wyoming Range, Gros Ventre Mountains, and the Wind River Mountains to the east.

in quiet East Jackson and within walking distance of Snow King, Cache Creek, and the National Elk Refuge, this remodeled main home and newly built guest house offer a mountain modern flair in one of the Town of Jackson's best neighborhoods. Originally built in 2004, the main home was extensively remodeled in 2022 with contemporary elements like new oak flooring, new kitchen counters and cabinets, and updated bathrooms. Exposed timbers and a rustic staircase add a touch of Western to an otherwise current color palette. The 3, 600 sq.ft. floor plan includes a ground-floor primary bedroom with an en-suite bath. Two guest bedrooms on the upper level - including one that looks north to the Grand Teton - provide separation from the rest of the home. A finished basement of more than 800 sq.ft. affords a 4th bedroom and additional space for storage, a media room or a host of other uses. Multiple decks provide intimate outdoor living spaces for entertaining or enjoying July 4th fireworks from the comfort of your own home. A newly constructed one-bedroom guest house of nearly 500 sq.ft. with views north to the Tetons sits atop a detached two-car garage accessed off a Town of Jackson maintained alley. Escape to the Cache Creek Trailhead for miles of hiking and mountain bike trails, or ride to the Town Square for dinner at the Snake River Grill. This East Jackson offering features in-town living at its finest.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"665 E Cache Creek Dr","street":"665 E Cache Creek

It is on the very productive east side of the Bighorn River among larger ranch holdings and farms. It is minutes from town, yet in a secluded area of agricultural residences and bordering thousands of acres of public ground. Thermopolis has one of the most temperate climates in Wyoming and has amenities including a new hospital, airport and schools. The nearby Bighorn River has become the destination for hundreds of avid fly fisherman from around the country. Cody and Yellowstone Park are within two hours and Thermopolis has a solid tourism, energy, and agricultural economic base. Property: The Cowboy Mine Farm is 27+\/- acres with 25 acres of high quality grass\/alfalfa hay under sideroll sprinkler. A gravel driveway takes you 1\/4 mile off the main road to the two residences, large heated shop, horse barn, arena, and large equipment and hay storage shed. The well maintained and designed property is adjacent to thousands of acres of public lands where you will find no neighbors and plenty of room to ride, hunt, or hike the unique and rugged landscape for miles around. Improvements: The 2100 square foot main home has an attached two car garage, deck, 3 bedrooms, office, and 2 baths. All on one level with great views. The property's second home is nearly 1100 square feet with an attached heated garage, shop and storage building of over 1400 square feet. This home has 3 bedrooms and 2 baths, with an enclosed porch. The horse facilities include a 2000 square foot horse barn with enclosed stalls with outside runs, cement breezeway, and tack room. Nearby is the 2400 square foot open faced hay storage and equipment shed. The corrals and arena are incorporated into the well thought out facilities. Water: The property has a domestic well that is currently not in use as it is set up with a large water storage facility supplied with city water sourced in Thermopolis and hauled to the property. Irrigation is supplied via the Kirby Irrigation District and pumped from a nearby catch pond to the properties sprinkler system. The system is reliable, efficient and cost effective.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"1164 Cowboy Mine Rd","street":"1164 Cowboy Mine

Sunny front porch is the first thing that welcomes you. Then you step into a newly redone and beautiful open floor plan. All of the original hardwood floors are redone along with all of the ornate wood trim and crown molding. Fully functional, updated modern kitchen is on the far end of the room. You will like the farm sink, vent-hood, soft close cabinets, upgraded appliances and plenty of space to cook your gourmet meals. 2 nice size bedrooms, 1 bathroom and more storage space on the back porch. Outside is a double corner lot that you can sit outside and enjoy a view of the Wind River Mountains. There is an old workshop on the lot but plenty of room to build a new garage. Alley Access.
