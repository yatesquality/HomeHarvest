If you are wanting a small hobby farm with the ability to have animals, check this one out! The east border of the property is in the gully where Schoolhouse creek runs through - such a peaceful sound! A great update: The owners have completed a speculative site evaluation and based on findings have been issued approval for the installation of an alternative septic system, without further investigation required. The property may qualify for a regular septic system, but the test holes would require monitoring from March 1-May 31st before that determination will be made by CDH.","style":"LAND","full_street_line":"Tbd Southfork Rd Lot 6","street":"Tbd Southfork Rd","unit":"Lot 6","city":"Garden Valley","state":"ID","zip_code":"83622","beds":null,"full_baths":null,"half_baths":null,"sqft":null,"year_built":null,"days_on_mls":29,"list_price":135000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-04-17","sold_price":null,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-16","assessed_value":null,"estimated_value":null,"tax":null,"tax_history":null,"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":56628,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Boise","fips_code":null,"stories":null,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"3725113","agent_name":"Lisa Willey","agent_email":"lisa@gardenvalleyproperties.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"2085821227"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-BOID-557211","agent_nrds_id":"345526695","broker_id":"100406809","broker_name":"Garden Valley Properties - Broker","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"100406811","office_mls_set":"O-BOID-12945","office_name":"Garden Valley Properties","office_email":"gvjimj@gmail.com","office_phones":[{"number":"(208) 462-4620","type":"BUSINESS_PHONE","primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":null,"primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m794603210od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m794603210od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m160651966od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m2873558369od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m218787102od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m3453199792od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m3207643551od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m335008167od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m4007875028od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m1384908344od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m3990850433od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m327635439od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m3027876162od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m3362682456od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m686365625od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a3c9328f751252bb889b6faf2e814da8l-m2065579239od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/5111-Highway-95_New-Meadows_ID_83654_M20898-73002","property_id":"2089873002","listing_id":"2977224681","mls":"BOID","mls_id":"98933134","status":"SOLD","text":"Take a look at this 2 bedroom, 2 bath, 1216 sq ft manufactured home on .84 acres, located north of New Meadows in the Little Salmon River Canyon.
