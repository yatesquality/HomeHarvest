TO THE HINDS 27.3, LOCATED ON SOUTH MCRAVEN ROAD JUST MINUTES FROM CLINTON, MS. This 27.3+\/- acre property provides the opportunity to own a tract of land at an affordable price! As you walk through the western Hinds County tract, you notice the topography is generally level throughout and made up of a nice mixture of hardwood and pine timber. A wide ridgetop runs through the middle of the property, with a gentle fall in elevation as you walk toward the north property line. An old trail system, a small pond, and a homesite provide a nice start for someone looking to establish their country homesite.

So much space inside and out! This updated beauty sits on just over 1 acre in the beautiful neighborhood of Sandalwood, just off Rice Rd in Madison. The cul-de-sac location is perfect for added privacy off the main entry. Beautiful old brick floors greet you at the front foyer and steps down the the large sunken den with its bold brick fireplace on the back wall. To the right of the foyer, the formal dining waits for special meals. The kitchen is a chef's delight with large butcher block island and quartz countertops on the perimeter where you will enjoy loads of countertop and storage space. One private guest suite with a private bath is located just off the breakfast area. Three additional bedrooms and two bathrooms, that include the owner's suite are located off of a separate hallway making this a great mother-in-law plan. The previous owner converted a covered back porch to a sunroom and that is now updated with new sliding doors to access the new deck in the spacious back yard. The original garage was enclosed previously to create a great den for entertaining (we hear it was a Karaoke heaven!) and has an old wood burning stove and a wet bar! With just over an acre there is plenty of room to add covered parking if you like, and at this price you can add value to the property. Out on the back corner of the property is a great storage shed too. Call your realtor today to view this updated, exceptional property!!","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"26 Blackberry Ln","street":"26 Blackberry Ln","unit":null,"city":"Madison","state":"MS","zip_code":"39110","beds":4,"full_baths":3,"half_baths":null,"sqft":3198,"year_built":1975,"days_on_mls":117,"list_price":389900,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-01-18","sold_price":null,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-15","assessed_value":30996,"estimated_value":382800,"tax":3611,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":3611,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":30996}},{"year":2023,"tax":1449,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":20664}},{"year":2022,"tax":1449,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":20664}},{"year":2021,"tax":1449,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":19941}},{"year":2020,"tax":1449,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":19941}},{"year":2019,"tax":1449,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":19941}},{"year":2018,"tax":1449,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":19941}},{"year":2017,"tax":1416,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":19652}},{"year":2016,"tax":1299,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":18652}},{"year":2015,"tax":1299,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":18652}},{"year":2014,"tax":2163,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":18564}},{"year":2013,"tax":2079,"assessment":{"building":13348,"land":4500,"total":17848}},{"year":2012,"tax":2079,"assessment":{"building":13348,"land":4500,"total":17848}},{"year":2011,"tax":2070,"assessment":{"building":13348,"land":4500,"total":17848}},{"year":2010,"tax":1765,"assessment":{"building":13301,"land":4500,"total":17801}},{"year":2009,"tax":1710,"assessment":{"building":12952,"land":4500,"total":17452}},{"year":2008,"tax":1660,"assessment":{"building":12943,"land":4000,"total":16943}},{"year":2007,"tax":1602,"assessment":{"building":12943,"land":4000,"total":16943}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":43560,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":32.438769,"longitude":-90.08862,"neighborhoods":"Sandalwood","county":"Madison","fips_code":"28089","stories":1,"hoa_fee":null,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"4632049","agent_name":"Stephanie Nix","agent_email":"stephanienix@remax.net","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"6018423606"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"6018423606"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-MUMS-1672","agent_nrds_id":null,"broker_id":"1652618","broker_name":"RE\/MAX Connection -

The formal dining room sits to the left, while straight ahead, the spacious living area features a handcrafted wood beam ceiling and a layout designed for both comfort and entertaining.Unlike many homes in the neighborhood, this one wasn't built on a template. It was custom-designed from the ground up, and it shows--from the thoughtful floor plan to the detailed finishes. The open kitchen features custom cabinetry, expansive counter space, and a layout perfect for anyone who enjoys cooking or gathering around the heart of the home. Just off the kitchen, you'll find a built-in desk nook with a solid wood top, a laundry room, and stairs leading to the oversized bonus room (which includes a half bath and serves perfectly as a fourth bedroom, media room, or office).The primary suite is tucked away just off the kitchen and includes more custom touches, like another wood-accented ceiling. Double doors lead into a spa-style bathroom with a jetted tub, walk-in shower, double vanities, and a huge walk-in closet.Outside, a large covered back porch extends your living space and is accessible from both the living room and primary bedroom.Located just minutes from Lakeland Drive, this home offers convenience to hospitals, top-rated schools including Highland Bluff Elementary and Northwest Rankin, and a wide variety of shopping and dining options at Dogwood Festival.Neighborhood amenities include walking and biking trails, a community pool, and a clubhouse--perfect for active families.This is not your average home, and it's not going to last.

Carroll 100 is a well-rounded, income-generating hunting tract in Carroll County, MS, located just 11 miles south of Greenwood. Covering approximately 100 acres, this property offers an excellent combination of deer and duck hunting opportunities with a diverse landscape. The eastern portion of the property features a thinned plantation pine stand enrolled in CRP, providing an annual income of $2, 340 through 2030. A long-established food plot runs between the pine rows, and easy access will allow you to slip in without disrupting the property. This section also includes two pole barns and a storage container, offering plenty of space for equipment and tool storage. With areas of high ground out of the floodplain, plus public water and power, there are multiple locations for a future cabin or hunting camp. The western half of the property transitions into classic Delta habitat, featuring multiple food plots, oak and willow flats, and an established duck hole with a water control structure. Additionally, a 10-acre section along the western boundary provides flexibility for planting additional food plots suited for deer, ducks, or even doves, maximizing the property's hunting potential. Tracts of this size that offer deer and duck hunting, income production, and on-site utilities are a rare find in this market. The Carroll 100 is a unique opportunity to invest in a multi-use property that delivers year-round recreational and financial benefits.","style":"LAND","full_street_line":"County Road

The one level split plan allows for plenty of privacy and the mid-century modern elements make it stylish and fun. The home offers numerous living areas, including a sunny living\/dining room, as well as a great room with fireplace and built-ins. There is also a breakfast area with skylights and wall of windows overlooking the screened porch and backyard. Adjacent to this space is an office with floor to ceiling windows. Abundant light throughout is just one of many selling points of the home. The great room adjoins the kitchen, which offers a gas range, glass tile backsplash, and in a nod to the mid-century modern style of the home, the owners replaced the countertops with linen-finish Formica with a polished aluminum trim. A breakfast bar with barstool seating and pendant lighting provides the perfect spot for casual meals. The spacious, private master suite features a fireplace, built-ins, walk-in closet and a bath with dual sinks, large jetted tub, separate shower and water closet. On the other side of the home, a bedroom with ensuite bath, plus two additional bedrooms and a hall bath round out the space. A spacious laundry room with plenty of storage, a sink and space for an extra fridge is located off the kitchen and overlooks the backyard. A door in the laundry room opens onto a room with so much potential- it is currently being used for storage, but by adding a vent or minisplit, this room could be incorporated into the home's living space and be used as an additional office, home gym, craft room, etc. The expansive screened porch is a treat and features built-in planters for seasonal color. The flat back yard provides plenty of space for gardening or backyard fun. All this and more, conveniently located in the Fondren district, and all the fun that entails.
