If you're looking for wide-open space plus the convenience of existing structures like a barn, chicken coop, tack shed, and covered parking for all your toys, this one is a must-see. The single-level home has been well maintained over the years and offers comfortable living, with plenty of potential for modern updates to make it your own. But what truly makes this property stand out is how well it's outfitted for rural living.

Nebo and the Red Cliffs, accompanied by the soft rhythm of sprinklers in the neighboring fields. Whether you're unwinding after a long day or starting fresh each morning, the quiet surroundings and wide-open skies make this a perfect retreat. And the location? It's ideal. Tucked away at the end of a quiet dead-end road, you'll enjoy a sense of privacy and stillness that's hard to find-yet you're still within easy reach of town conveniences like schools, shopping, and services. Plus, being situated on a county-maintained road means year-round accessibility without the upkeep stress. If you're ready for more space, more freedom, and unbeatable views-and don't mind a little TLC-this is the one.

STUNNING REMODEL with ADU, detached 400 sf shed (with power and mini split cooling\/ heating) on a 0.27-acre corner lot! The current owners brought their incredible vision to life, starting with relocating the kitchen and replacing it with a walk-in (nay, waltz-in) PANTRY. The CHEF'S DREAM KITCHEN is not only gorgeous-featuring European-style cabinets, wood accent beams, and quartz countertops-but also wildly functional, with a glass-top induction range and pot filler, vented hood, expansive counter space, new stainless steel appliances, and a large island, all offering panoramic views of the beautiful backyard and the watershed beyond, where you'll spot horses, foxes, and birds. Downstairs is the Hillview Lounge, a moody modern 2-bed, 1-bath ADU complete with full kitchen, dining, living area, and access to the laundry room (which can also be reached from the garage by the main level). Use the downstairs to expand your living space, accommodate multigenerational living, or live upstairs and Airbnb the lower level. Other noteworthy features include the fireplace upstairs and the sun-drenched atrium at the front of the home. The backyard is a dream, with garden boxes, fruit trees, a patio for dining or relaxing. The oversized 2-car garage offers extra storage space, leaving your larger detached shed free to become an office, art studio, pilates space-or all three-while the smaller shed could be your pottery kiln room or anything else you can imagine. Throughout the home, enjoy custom cordless window shades.

If you're looking for an affordable and comfortable place to call home with a little more breathing room, this is a wonderful option to consider!","style":"MOBILE","full_street_line":"3870 N Minersville Hwy Spc 42","street":"3870 N Minersville Hwy","unit":"Spc 42","city":"Cedar City","state":"UT","zip_code":"84721","beds":3,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":null,"sqft":825,"year_built":1989,"days_on_mls":20,"list_price":69900,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-04-29","sold_price":null,"last_sold_date":null,"assessed_value":null,"estimated_value":null,"tax":null,"tax_history":null,"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":3049,"price_per_sqft":85,"latitude":37.748386,"longitude":-113.053558,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Iron","fips_code":"49021","stories":1,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"2014968","agent_name":"Mari Eddy","agent_email":"mari.eddy@cedarcityera.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"4355922172"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"4355862777"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-SGUT-ERACCMEDDY","agent_nrds_id":"834501142","broker_id":"968995","broker_name":"ERA Realty Center - UT","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"44185","office_mls_set":"O-SGUT-ERACC","office_name":"ERA Realty Center","office_email":"erarealtycenter@gmail.com","office_phones":[{"number":"4355862777","type":"Office","primary":true,"ext":null},{"number":"4355867652","type":"Fax","primary":false,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"Iron District, Gateway Preparatory Academy","primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m3306335511od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m3306335511od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m3238067261od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m3471439223od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m1581866366od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m1108777992od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m1791896778od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m2634514743od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m980086197od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m1759088915od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m1493931191od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m3751627940od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m1073015114od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m1931533158od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m1093811990od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m1497474549od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m3061202528od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m3992554349od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m3422768711od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/d450fa5df46d1849d452967456c85e9fl-m3023422363od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/167-Hillcrest-Dr_Price_UT_84501_M12262-15708","property_id":"1226215708","listing_id":"2981924404","mls":"SAUT","mls_id":"2085376","status":"FOR_SALE","text":"Stunning Late-70s Contemporary with Modern Updates & Exceptional Layout Welcome to this beautifully maintained contemporary home, nestled on a desirable corner lot with a spacious driveway.

a great escape located up Logan Canyon right off of the river. This cabin has it all: Amazing kitchen with granite counters and updated cupboards, heating can be done with wood fireplace, propane wall heater or electric wall heater. There is an open screened sitting deck on the front of the cabin where you can relax, watch the local animals or read a book while being able to feel the cool mtn breeze and listening to the flowing river in the background all without any bugs or critters to bother you. 1000 gal propane tank is what feeds the heater and kitchen stove. This is your chance to escape the valley and have a mtn retreat of your own. Properties do not come up very often in this area so don't miss this chance to make this your own! Independent measurements are suggested as all data was pulled from county records. This is located on Forest Service land and is leased to the home owner.

Built in 1994, the home is solid, comfortable, and has had all major systems in the home replaced or updated in the past 8 years, along with all new flooring and paint throughout the home. This includes a brand new MyQ smart garage door opener, Kinetico water softener and B-Hyve smart sprinkler system. One of the standout features is the second kitchen downstairs featuring stainless steel appliances and under cabinet lighting. Whether you're thinking about multi-generational living, hosting guests, or maybe even creating some rental income, the basement setup gives you all kinds of options. Upstairs, you'll find a welcoming layout with generous bedrooms, open living spaces, and a kitchen that's ready for all your everyday meals or big family dinners. Outside, the cul-de-sac location gives you that peaceful, low-traffic vibe, and you're still right in the heart of the Salt Lake Valley, close to schools, shopping, parks, and easy freeway access. A large shed in great condition in the back gives great storage and over 100 feet of RV parking for a trailer or vehicles and plenty of room to grow.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"2332

Place holds an enduring and distinctive place in Salt Lake City's legacy. You'll be carried away to another time and place as you pass through the sandstone archways at the corner of South Temple and Haxton Place. The picturesque cul-de-sac is lined with stately homes and a canopy of mature trees, reminiscent of a prestigious English enclave. In 1909, the street was touted as One of the most handsome and exclusive residence sections in the city in Goodwin's Weekly Newspaper. The homes were described as Graceful expressions of utility by the Salt Lake Herald Republican in October of 1909. While it's been more than a century since these statements were printed, they still hold true. The ivy-covered estate holding court at the far end of the lane is 35 Haxton Place. 35 Haxton Place on the east side and 34 Haxton Place on the west side. Each of these properties are currently available for sale. Built in 1907 for members of the city's high society, these halls exude an air of historical significance. Many elements of the original craftsmanship continue to shine, such as the grand staircase and exposed beam ceilings, validating its place on the National Historic Register. The current owners have gone to great lengths to accurately restore the home to its proper state of grandeur. They carefully researched the home's provenance before refurbishing original elements such as the light fixtures and woodwork. Many practical modern updates have been made in recent years as well, such as the well-appointed kitchen that glows with natural light. Newly completed professional landscaping of the side yard aligns perfectly with the home's historic character and provides the perfect setting for garden parties. A greenhouse is attached to the lower level of the home for year-round gardening and a two-car garage can be accessed through an alley. Surrounded by historic homes and an immaculate garden, you will likely forget that you're just a stone's throw from downtown. Salt Lake City's finest restaurants and cultural institutions are minutes away. A quick drive up South Temple will take you to the University of Utah. This property is a treasured piece of Salt Lake City's history, a testament to the enduring power of quality craftsmanship. It also holds the promise of a bright future, with many more stories to write.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"35 S Haxton Pl","street":"35 S Haxton Pl","unit":null,"city":"Salt Lake

And speaking of storage, there is a shed in the backyard for a workshop for all of your gardening desires. Plus, those Black Stainless steel appliances not only look great but make day-to-day living feel like a touch of luxury. The 3rd bedroom would make the perfect nursery or maybe you need a home office instead.

Creek Ranch Private Mountain Estate with Off-Grid Features and Recreational Appeal, Serene creek running through property Discover Thistle Creek Ranch, a serene mountain retreat just minutes from the heart of Utah County. Nestled off Highway 89 near Spanish Fork Canyon, this gated property offers the perfect balance of seclusion and accessibility-only 18 minutes from I-15, Costco, other stores, so close yet feels remote when you are out here. This 8-bedroom, 5-bathroom main residence is designed for versatility and comfort, with stunning panoramic views, multiple decks, and abundant outdoor gathering spaces. The backyard is a true oasis featuring a rock waterfall, a large fireplace, and manicured lawns. A separate mother-in-law suite includes its own entrance, kitchenette, living area, and deck. The home is ideal for family retreats, large gatherings, or even weddings, with office spaces, a craft room, a dorm-style room for guests or kids, and a full lower-level apartment with a second kitchen and wood-burning stove. Built with self-sufficiency in mind, the home includes 78 roof-mounted solar panels for electricity, 12 thermal panels for winter heat, and a 2, 000-gallon propane capacity. Thistle Creek Ranch has permanent rights to up to 12 acre-feet of water from the Spanish Fork City main line, delivering year-round spring water-filtered but untreated for those desiring chemical-free water. Additional infrastructure includes a large food storage room, reliable grid power, and high-speed internet. The 40' x 60' post-and-beam barn is solar-powered and ideal for horses, recreation, parties or events. A separate outbuilding serves as a heated gym and tack shed. The property spans varied terrain from 5, 100 to over 6, 200 feet in elevation. Thistle Creek meanders through the lower meadows, feeding a picturesque pond. Fenced pastures and irrigated paddocks surround the main compound, while the upper ranch features dramatic rock cliffs, meadows, and wooded trails. A secluded shooting range and plentiful wildlife-including elk, deer, and wild turkey-make this a hunter's paradise. Thistle Creek is known for its brown trout, and the ranch participates in the Utah DWR walk-in access program for seasonal rainbow trout fishing. Additional recreational opportunities include horseback riding, mountain biking, hiking, and camping, with potential sites for yurts or family campgrounds on the upper property. Previously used as both a private ranch and a residential treatment center, Thistle Creek Ranch is uniquely suited for personal or commercial use.

Built in 1924, this significant structure, once the site of the original Lewiston State Bank, has monumental potential for a future home owner, investor, business owner, or landlord. This impressive red brick and precast stone structure is located on the corner of Center and Main in Lewiston, giving it a downtown feeling in one of Cache Valley's most charming rural towns. The former bank has been vacant for several decades and needs some TLC, but it has some recent structural updates including: new windows, new sheeting on the second floor, reinforced structural beams for the second floor and roof, and new membrane roof. It is currently zoned commercial, however, the Lewiston City Council and Planning and Zoning have expressed willingness to accommodate owner's interested in mixed use, single family, or multi-family housing. Though it is not currently on the Historic Registry, funding for renovations through the Registry may be available. The building comes with 1.5 official parking stalls in back, though 2 cars will likely fit as well as daytime street parking on the west and north sides. Lewiston has also offered the potential of a long term lease of additional spots for multiple tenants, guests, employees, or customers. The building currently has a water meter on the property but will need to be connected along with power, natural gas, and sewer. Original blueprints and proposed single family floor plans included in the listing photos.","style":"TOWNHOMES","full_street_line":"1 S Main St","street":"1 S Main

spectacular 360 degree panoramic views like no other in Cache Valley! You really do have to see a sunset up here to fully appreciate it! This gorgeous fully renovated hilltop home also comes with 3 acres and horse property! Even though it's actually 3 acres, it feels more like 30 because of the size of the adjacent lots and the space between the other homes. You can have everyone over with 2 large family rooms, 2 fireplaces, a large island, and an open-concept kitchen\/dining area on the main level, plus an additional living room in the basement. The renovation is comprehensive - both inside and out have been completely redone, including new roof, siding, windows, doors, hardwood floors, mouldings, cabinets, quartz countertops, outlets, switches, and plumbing valves and fixtures. The upper level features a spacious master suite, complete with fantastic views in all directions, a custom shiplap fireplace, and a balcony! There are 3 additional bedrooms on the upper level, including an oversized bedroom that would make a great bunk room or game room as well as a dedicated office. There is ample space to build a shop or barn. There is also an electrical transfer switch which makes it easy to use a generator for backup or emergency whole home power. The fully finished garage features epoxy floors and brand new garage door openers. A water softener, high efficiency furnace, and two air conditioning condensers top off the list of new equipment, all calculated to make owning this home a stress-free experience.

is one of those homes that just feels different. Maybe it's the way the light dances on the water. Or how the sunsets stretch endlessly across the mountains. Or maybe it's the rare walk-out basement -nearly impossible to find in this 55+ community- that opens up to layered views of the pond, green fairways, and glowing desert skies. Perched on one of the best lots in SunRiver, this thoughtfully, custom, designed home gives you two full levels of indoor-outdoor living, all framed by nature. On the main level living, vaulted ceilings and oversized windows bring the scenery front and center. The kitchen is warm and inviting with granite counters, stainless appliances, and a large island that's made for casual conversations and gatherings. The great room, with custom built-ins, flows out to a screened-in patio, complete with fireplace and TV, for year-round enjoyment of the view. The primary suite is your private escape, with a cozy bay window perfect for reading, and a spa-inspired bath that invites you to slow down and soak it all in. Downstairs, the walk-out basement opens to the backyard and expands your living space for your extra hobbies, grandkid chaos, or a live-in care-giver. High ceilings for a large rec room, wet bar, fireplace, two guest suites, and a home office with built-in bookshelves. There's even a big pantry and storage room for all your extras. The setting truly steals the show. Whether you're enjoying your morning coffee or hosting friends, the water, mountain, and golf views make every moment feel like a getaway. Located just around the corner from Veterans Memorial Park and miles of trails, you'll also have access to everything SunRiver offers; resort-style pools, pickleball, tennis, fitness, clubs, crafts, and more. And yes, it has a two-car garage plus a golf cart bay, because in this neighborhood, that's practically essential. This is more than a home. It's where beauty, peace, and possibility come together.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"1956 W Wide River Dr","street":"1956 W Wide River Dr","unit":null,"city":"Saint

open layout is key for creating that welcoming and flexible vibe, where you can seamlessly move from enjoying a quiet night to hosting a fun gathering. The oversized garage and RV hookup really cater to those with an adventurous spirit or a need for extra space for projects and storage. And speaking of storage, there is a shed in the backyard for a workshop for all of your gardening desires. Plus, those Black Stainless steel appliances not only look great but make day-to-day living feel like a touch of luxury. The 3rd bedroom would make the perfect nursery or maybe you need a home office instead. One of the great things about this area of Enoch is that you still have animal rights, meaning you can have your horse right in you backyard.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"4429 N Half
