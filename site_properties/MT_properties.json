This beautifully renovated Lakefront Holiday Village beauty will not disappoint. From the moment you pull up out front, you can't help but notice how impeccably taken care of this home is. Enter through the front door and notice the much-desired open concept. The entire interior has been renovated to include new hardwood floors, new interior doors and hardware, new window treatments, two completely renovated bathrooms, new light fixtures, wall switches, and recessed lighting, and it has been completely repainted! The new kitchen with table space is a chef's dream, with new shaker custom cabinets, quartz countertops, and GE Profile stainless appliances. An additional wall of cabinets was added to create pantry space and a wonderful coffee bar. The dining room is large enough to host family holiday gatherings, and being open to the living room makes entertaining a breeze. Beyond the living room is the sunroom. It might just be your favorite spot to sit as the skylights allow so much natural light to shine through, and the view of the lake is absolutely serene! The primary bedroom is spacious with a new ceiling fan and has a custom-designed walk-in closet. The renovated primary bathroom features a double vanity and a walk-in shower with custom Carrara chevron tile. This room also faces the lake, so you can wake up in the morning to look out at the beautiful view of the water. In the second bedroom, you will find a new ceiling fan and a good-sized closet. The new hall bath also features a tub\/shower combination and custom shower tile. Down the hall, you find the laundry room with a brand-new washer and dryer. This room also houses the heater and air conditioning systems, which were installed in 2024. Outside the sunroom is the paved patio space. This is the best place to enjoy your morning coffee or evening glass of wine. The much sought-after-lake view in this community is not easy to get! The attached garage comes with an extra refrigerator. Aside from all of this, you have nothing to do but unpack and enjoy the home. No more grass-cutting or snow shoveling here! The community heated pool is wonderful to enjoy on summer days, and the Club House has many activities as well. This one will not last long!","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"62 Bastian Dr","street":"62 Bastian Dr","unit":null,"city":"Mount Laurel","state":"NJ","zip_code":"08054","beds":2,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":null,"sqft":1331,"year_built":1986,"days_on_mls":42,"list_price":460000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-04-03","sold_price":470000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-15","assessed_value":172300,"estimated_value":453400,"tax":5439,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":5439,"assessment":{"building":118000,"land":54300,"total":172300}},{"year":2023,"tax":5234,"assessment":{"building":118000,"land":54300,"total":172300}},{"year":2022,"tax":5217,"assessment":{"building":118000,"land":54300,"total":172300}},{"year":2021,"tax":5119,"assessment":{"building":118000,"land":54300,"total":172300}},{"year":2020,"tax":5019,"assessment":{"building":118000,"land":54300,"total":172300}},{"year":2019,"tax":4967,"assessment":{"building":118000,"land":54300,"total":172300}},{"year":2018,"tax":4929,"assessment":{"building":118000,"land":54300,"total":172300}},{"year":2017,"tax":4802,"assessment":{"building":118000,"land":54300,"total":172300}},{"year":2016,"tax":4729,"assessment":{"building":118000,"land":54300,"total":172300}},{"year":2015,"tax":4674,"assessment":{"building":118000,"land":54300,"total":172300}},{"year":2014,"tax":4627,"assessment":{"building":118000,"land":54300,"total":172300}},{"year":2013,"tax":5610,"assessment":{"building":90200,"land":33100,"total":123300}},{"year":2012,"tax":5347,"assessment":{"building":90200,"land":33100,"total":123300}},{"year":2011,"tax":5263,"assessment":{"building":90200,"land":33100,"total":123300}},{"year":2009,"tax":5004,"assessment":{"building":90200,"land":33100,"total":123300}},{"year":2008,"tax":4899,"assessment":{"building":90200,"land":33100,"total":123300}},{"year":2007,"tax":4780,"assessment":{"building":90200,"land":33100,"total":123300}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":6281,"price_per_sqft":353,"latitude":39.929974,"longitude":-74.912569,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Burlington","fips_code":"34005","stories":1,"hoa_fee":130,"parking_garage":1,"agent_id":"1829736","agent_name":"Bonnie Walter","agent_email":"bonniewalter@kw.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"6097069750"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"8563211212"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Other","number":"8563211414"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-PHPA-3162127","agent_nrds_id":"604514343","broker_id":"969298","broker_name":"Keller Williams Realty Cherry Hill","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"557311","office_mls_set":"O-PHPA-KELWLM-M","office_name":"Keller Williams Realty -

slice of heaven! Situated on the interior of a Timbercrest cul de sac on one of the largest lots in the neighborhood, you've found 604 Ashberry Ct. This proud colonial has curb appeal galore - a covered full front porch is accented in white, and a large grassy front yard is as pretty as a picture. Step inside to a beautiful interior. To the left, a large formal living room is an elegant space; just imagine holidays and formal gatherings on this quiet side of the home! A bar nook makes entertaining easy, and there's lots of room for TV watching and plentiful seating. Across the hall, a dining room is currently in use as a playroom, but could easily be set back up to accommodate fine dining. How nice to have a flexible first floor room! Next you'll find a newly renovated kitchen set to impress. Modern gray cabinetry pairs beautifully with updated stainless steel appliances, white herringbone backsplash, and black-and-blonde accents. A white country sink has a window placed right above it so that doing dishes comes with a view. Updated wood-tile flooring spans the entire kitchen & adjoined dining space. Additional cabinets & workspace can be found near the fridge, and a handy center island gives you room to prep, serve or even dine! Notice electric upgrades throughout including lighting and power in various places. Warmed by a woodburning fireplace, the breakfast dining area is both casual and elegant, perfect for every day meals or special occasions. A painted brick wall serves as a beautiful accent, and there's room for a TV, sideboard, and more. Also on this level - a newly renovated & beautiful powder room, large laundry room with storage, plus access to the 2 car garage (with EV charger & lots of storage above!) and finished basement. Upstairs, a large primary suite features two closets including a walk-in, and a large primary bath is neutral and pretty. Two additional nicely sized bedrooms share a main hall bath, and take note of the nook at the top of the stairs which is a completely flexible and unique spot. On our lowest level, a fully finished basement serves as an ideal additional living or play space. Whether you think of this as a casual family room, exercise area, play room or other, you'll be so glad to have this XL space away from it all. (And it's all kept dry by a sump pump and full perimeter french drain.) Storage aplenty can be found back by the utilities and under the stairs. On to the showpiece back yard - first take in the beautiful 3 season room. This screened in sanctuary gives you an easy way to connect with the outdoors while protected from the elements. And what better way to transition to the yard - can you believe it? This is one of the largest and most interior parcels in the community, and these homeowners have made it into YARD GOALS. The home is surrounded in 3 areas by a deck, a brick patio, and a contrete patio. You can decide how to best use these spaces to suite your needs. A grassy, open yard stretches in all directions, with a firepit off in a corner, highlighted by string lights. A storage shed helps you keep things neat and tidy, and a gardening area will delight those of you with a green thumb without overwhelming the yard. There's so much to explore out here, and you'll have visions of seasonal memories made. Let's talk location - instant access to 295 and just a short trip to NJ Turnpike. Close to beautiful parks, golf, Rancocas State Park + village, Moorestown Mall, Downtowns Moorestown & Mt Holly, major shopping destinations, antiquing, farms and more. Easy access to point north, south, shore and city. Excellent schools and municipal services! So much to love.... why not say yes?","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"604 Ashberry Ct","street":"604 Ashberry Ct","unit":null,"city":"Mount Laurel","state":"NJ","zip_code":"08054","beds":3,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":1,"sqft":2330,"year_built":1984,"days_on_mls":57,"list_price":539900,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-02-26","sold_price":585000,"last_sold_date":"2025-04-24","assessed_value":285600,"estimated_value":542839,"tax":9016,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":9016,"assessment":{"building":188800,"land":96800,"total":285600}},{"year":2023,"tax":8676,"assessment":{"building":188800,"land":96800,"total":285600}},{"year":2022,"tax":8647,"assessment":{"building":188800,"land":96800,"total":285600}},{"year":2021,"tax":8485,"assessment":{"building":188800,"land":96800,"total":285600}},{"year":2020,"tax":8319,"assessment":{"building":188800,"land":96800,"total":285600}},{"year":2019,"tax":8233,"assessment":{"building":188800,"land":96800,"total":285600}},{"year":2018,"tax":8171,"assessment":{"building":188800,"land":96800,"total":285600}},{"year":2017,"tax":7959,"assessment":{"building":188800,"land":96800,"total":285600}},{"year":2016,"tax":7839,"assessment":{"building":188800,"land":96800,"total":285600}},{"year":2015,"tax":7748,"assessment":{"building":188800,"land":96800,"total":285600}},{"year":2014,"tax":7671,"assessment":{"building":188800,"land":96800,"total":285600}},{"year":2013,"tax":7566,"assessment":{"building":101500,"land":64800,"total":166300}},{"year":2012,"tax":7212,"assessment":{"building":101500,"land":64800,"total":166300}},{"year":2011,"tax":7099,"assessment":{"building":101500,"land":64800,"total":166300}},{"year":2009,"tax":6750,"assessment":{"building":101500,"land":64800,"total":166300}},{"year":2008,"tax":6608,"assessment":{"building":101500,"land":64800,"total":166300}},{"year":2007,"tax":6447,"assessment":{"building":101500,"land":64800,"total":166300}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":17270,"price_per_sqft":251,"latitude":39.990734,"longitude":-74.869036,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Burlington","fips_code":"34005","stories":2,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"1315468","agent_name":"Eliza Babcock","agent_email":"eliza.babcock@gmail.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"8562960530"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"8563211212"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-PHPA-3190944","agent_nrds_id":"604513482","broker_id":"969298","broker_name":"Keller Williams Realty Cherry Hill","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"557311","office_mls_set":"O-PHPA-KELWLM-M","office_name":"Keller Williams Realty -
