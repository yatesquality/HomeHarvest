The room is complemented by built-in sofas, upholstered in soft yet durable Sunbrella fabric, creating the perfect space for relaxation or entertaining. Beautiful clay Saltillo tiles warm the floors, adding an authentic touch to this open, airy space. The heart of the home is the open-concept kitchen, featuring a custom-designed layout with a large wooden island, polished concrete countertops, and handcrafted wood cabinetry. Ample counter space makes cooking a pleasure, whether you're preparing a meal at the bar or dining al fresco on the serene terrace, surrounded by lush greenery and unparalleled views.

To the right of the foyer (an adaptable space, suitable as a dining space or a relaxing reading nook), youll find a cozy alcove with two twin beds, followed by the spacious terrace suite - a tranquil room with a king bed and a partial ocean view. The principal suite is a sanctuary of its own, featuring an ensuite bathroom and direct access to both the terrace and a private patio, where you can unwind among the palm trees and lush landscaping. The second full bathroom offers unique details, including colorful Spanish cement tiles, adding character and a traditional touch. Outside, the grounds consist of a 5, 351 sqft lot with easy to maintain foliage, a mature breadfruit tree and coconut palms. The land is sufficient for building a pool and a sunbathing deck. The home was designed for the possibility of building up in the future or adding a rooftop terrace which would maximize views.

Designed for comfort and convenience with air conditioning in all the bedrooms, ensuring cool, restful nights and a convenient two-car parking pad - a rare luxury for in town living. The owners have enjoyed this house a part time family vacation home, with great rental history while away.
