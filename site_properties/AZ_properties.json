Beautiful piece of property with access from both Reed Road and FM 730. Nice flat property. Land is in the county so there aren't any city restrictions. Build whatever you want on this land. It could easily be used for commercial property as well. The location is great! Map it out 13345 Briar Road in Azle and then this piece is the corner piece on FM 730 and Reed Road.

you walk through the foyer, to the left, the second and third bedrooms are perfectly situated for a private guest getaway. On the right, utilize the flex room for a home office, craft room or play area for young kids. This unique space offers the chance to customize your home to fit the needs of your family. Continuing through to the open kitchen, the extended countertops and island are the ideal workspace for anything from a simple family dinner to a culinary masterpiece. A walk-in pantry with two walls of storage means maximum space for all your snacks and ingredients. Situated in the back corner, the owners suite is the epitome of space and comfort. With a door right off the family room, this bedroom gives you a lot of natural light and easy access to the outdoor covered patio. A double-sink vanity means youll never have to share space again.

2, 475-square-foot Barrow floor plan incorporates 4 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, and an open concept in the main living area, with an easy flow from one space to the next. The kitchen, dining area, and family room come together, each with a dedicated space but no walls to divide themperfect for togetherness. When you need a break from that togetherness, its just a few steps to the owner's suite, which we situated on the first floor for privacy and convenience. The owner's bath is styled with dual, but separate, vanities, a soaking tub, walk-in shower, and a private water closet. Your walk-in closet features our higher standard for closet organization. If all this space is quite enough, weve included a flex room off the foyer, with a double-door entry. Transform it into a form dining or living room, home office, study, man cave, playroom, or even a guest room.

forever home awaits in Deer Glade, a gated community of custom homes built on multi-acre homesites. This modern farmhouse inspired home built by LBK Custom Homes is situated on a heavily wooded lot with a creek running through the back of the property. Luxurious designer finishes, thoughtful upgrades, and an exceptional outdoor living space set this home apart from the rest. With over 3, 000 sq ft of indoor living space, four dedicated bedrooms, four full bathrooms, a study, and a flex room that can serve as a game room, media room, or a fifth bedroom, there is no shortage of space for the entire family. The front entry features oversized French doors wrapped in an elegant natural wood casing leading to artfully arranged marble floor slabs in the foyer. From the foyer you'll enter the great room and gourmet kitchen, where you'll marvel at the size of the quartz eat-in kitchen island, the swanky contrast of the black and white counters, backsplash, and cabinets, the floor-to-ceiling painted brick fireplace, and the encased 20 foot six panel western sliding glass doors that blend the indoor and outdoor living spaces. Your outdoor living oasis features a second painted brick fireplace, a built-in grill, a heated resort style pool and spa with sheer descent water features, and a gas fire pit for added warmth and ambiance. Built-in cabinets throughout the home and a decked attic accessible via a hidden staircase provide ample room for storage. The oversized utility room offers a vast amount of cabinet and countertop space in addition to a full size washer, dryer, and second refrigerator or freezer. The expansive three-car garage features an extra deep bay for your recreational vehicles or shop space. Other practical upgrades include a buried 250 gallon propane tank, backyard irrigation, and spray foam insulation on the roof and all exterior walls. There is a partially cleared area at the end of the driveway for the next owner to build a shop to their heart's desire.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"386 Glade Valley Rd","street":"386

just off Church Road, this Autumn Homes' Gold Leaf Edition offers 2, 558 square feet of living space, including 3 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. Unlike the typical black-and-white farmhouses found in nearby subdivisions, this property sits on a one-acre lot surrounded by mature trees, which are often lacking in newer constructions. The spacious backyard is filled with trees, giving you the option to maintain it as a natural oak forest or transform it into a park-like retreat. There is also plenty of room to add a workshop, man cave, or she shed. While the home does not currently feature agreeable gray, you will have convenient access to Azle, Weatherford, and Fort Worth, allowing you to choose your preferred colors from any paint

built brick home on a corner lot with a huge fenced backyard is ready for your imagination. This 3 bed, 2 bath home is less than 5 years old and is a great layout. The kitchen is huge with granite counters, all wood, custom cabinets, tons of counter space for the cook or baker among you and bar seating too. There is a large walk in pantry to keep things organized and the laundry room is right off the kitchen. The living room has vaulted ceilings and is spacious and inviting while being open to the kitchen which makes entertaining easier. The master suite has 10 ft coffered ceilings, crown moulding and plenty of space to unwind at the end of the day. The en suite bath has dual sinks, granite counters, a deep soaking tub with tiled surround and a separate shower. The walk in closet is spacious as well. Two guest rooms each have vaulted ceilings, nice sized closets and lots of natural light. The backyard is fully fenced and dog proof and would be a great place to throw a football, host a cook out or start your own garden. This is a quiet neighborhood without an HOA and is just 20 minutes from Downtown Fort Worth and moments from local shopping and restaurants.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"1612
