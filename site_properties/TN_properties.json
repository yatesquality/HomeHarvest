There is a neighborhood park, Maloney Park (previously Maxey's boat dock), on the lake with a boat ramp, playground, picnic pavilion, and a walking trail. The pocket park established in 2017 on Circle Lake, Lakemoor Legacy Park and Garden, is a certified wildlife habitat and is a rain garden demonstration project. Additionally, there are plans for the greenway to be constructed\/expanded to connect Maloney Rd Park to I.C. King Park crossing the UT Farms property allowing Lakemoor Hills residents to walk or bike to two county parks. Adjoining lot at 2101 Woodmere also available. Perfect for the discerning buyer who appreciates both prestige and natural beauty, this property presents a once-in-a-lifetime chance to establish a waterfront legacy in one of Knoxville's most

in the winter and the privacy of a green forest surrounding you in summer, and to watch the sunrise over Bays Mt shining rays of light through the trees and mist in Smoky mountain morning style, then wind up the private drive at 1313 Bays Mt Rd. Leave our rural neighbors in the valley and arrive on top at our Red Ridge Mountain home retreat. We are only 18 minutes from downtown Knoxville and 25 minutes from Sevierville, so close yet so different. It's all waiting for you to begin the rest best years of your life.

miss the virtual tour: If you've ever said, ''They don't make 'em like they used to, '' this South Knoxville charmer's for you! This remodeled, all-brick ranch in the beloved Arrowhead Subdivision is the epitome of ''home sweet home.'' With just two small steps up to the front door and an oversized 2-car garage, this cozy rambler is as welcoming as it is well-built. Loved and well-maintained by just 1 family for 5 decades and now beautifully updated by a local, experienced renovator (160+ homes!), this home anxiously awaits its next family! The big-ticket items have already been taken care of, so you don't have to! Brand new electric panel, gas HVAC and gas hot water heater are just 1 year young, energy-efficient windows, and matchy stainless-steel appliances. Exterior features include 6-inch gutters, storm doors, 12x40 patio, utility building, and long, level asphalt driveway (think basketball goal, scooters, sidewalk chalk, and guest parking!) on over a half-acre level lot. Fresh LVP flooring, crisp neutral paint and trim give this classic beauty a stylish, updated feel, ready to adapt to any decor you bring. Don't worry! The owner left the timeless slate floor at the entrance. All that's left for you to do is hang your own pictures and curtains... and start making memories. Cozy up by the fireplace in the dining\/warming room, sprawl out in the massive living room (almost 14x20) with a big, beautiful bay window, or host a backyard cook-out with family and friends on the gigantic (12x40) patio. The level yard is a dreamy playground for the kids\/grandkids. Imagine the countless fireflies that are waiting to be chased! Bring your furbabies, too! With tons of room left over, plant that garden, build that playset, or even that Clark Griswold pool you've always dreamed of! Or join the community pool for $325 for a family of 4. With its updates, neutral colors, and location, this home is a blank canvas for your personal style. Both bathrooms are fully functional and are ready for your pinterest inspiration! Come fall in love with Arrowhead, one of the best walking and trick-or-treating neighborhoods around, where neighbors become friends, there's no HOA, and you're just minutes from Knoxville's or Maryville's favorite spots. This home is eligible for USDA, but not FHA.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"6021 Frontier Trl","street":"6021 Frontier

The front of the property has been beautifully maintained and the back of the property has a wonderful garden\/patio area and a stone staircase that leads to trails that wander throughout the rest of the nearly 1 acre property. The house, being mostly stone, has all the charm, craftsmanship, originality, and character that so many are trying to recreate or own. As you enter the house, the living room, adorned with a beautiful fireplace, is inviting and quickly establishes the character of the house. Arched doorways and arched ceilings seamlessly lead you from one room to the next. The vintage sliding pocket doors, glass door knobs, built in shelves and cut outs, chandeliers, and arched doorways are just a few of the many subtleties that are truly special in the home. The kitchen is open and spacious and lead to a wonderful dining room that make this house wonderful for gathering with friends and family. Each room on the main level shares the cozy charm and character of the home and the subtle touches of historical originality are something that is rare and difficulty to find. The primary bedroom has its own private bath. The other bedrooms on the main level offer ample space and comfort as well. Upstairs, you will find two more bedrooms, another sunroom, and a flex room with a sink and 240 volt plug. So this flex room could easily be converted into another kitchen area or utility room for the home. Going downstairs into the 2 car garage\/basement you are instantly greeted by an enormous amount of work and storage space.

Thankfully, this two-story basement home built in 2023 is conveniently tucked between both! As you walk inside your home, you'll be greeted with all new light fixtures, beautifully designed touches and kitchen hardware completed by Haventry Designs. Speaking of the kitchen, it's an entertainer's dream with a spacious pantry and sleek island flowing easily into the living room & back deck. The back deck overlooks stunning mountain views just beyond your back neighbors (who are, by the way, a good distance away!). It's a dreamy spot for conversations over a local brew after a day of hikes through the mountains or jaunts downtown. After the conversations wrap up, you can head upstairs to relax in your spacious primary bedroom featuring an oversized walk-in-closet and roomy double vanity. The second level also features two secondary bedrooms and a little nook to just hang out - perfect for any mini adventurers or visiting pals who need to recoup from the day as well. If your hike has left you a little... well, stinky, you can conveniently throw your clothes right in the laundry located upstairs as well. Want to make the space your own? The unfinished (but already plumbed for a half bathroom) basement is set up and ready for you to choose your own adventure! Just like choosing between the mountains or the city, you can choose to finish the basement into a state of the art workout space or a cozy apartment for visiting pals. We don't know how the basement will end up, but we do know this: Whether your day takes you to the top of Mt. Leconte or the middle of Market Square, you'll always want the day to end in your beautiful new home!","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"521 Hayley Marie Ln","street":"521 Hayley Marie Ln","unit":null,"city":"Knoxville","state":"TN","zip_code":"37920","beds":3,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":1,"sqft":2160,"year_built":2023,"days_on_mls":67,"list_price":409900,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2024-11-01","sold_price":409900,"last_sold_date":"2025-01-07","assessed_value":72950,"estimated_value":405242,"tax":1134,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":1134,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":72950}},{"year":2023,"tax":109,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":7000}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":5663,"price_per_sqft":190,"latitude":35.909969,"longitude":-83.860725,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Knox","fips_code":"47093","stories":2,"hoa_fee":33,"parking_garage":2,"agent_id":"3969238","agent_name":"Emily Stevens","agent_email":"emily@move2knox.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"8655883232"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"8655883232"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-KXTN-339283","agent_nrds_id":null,"broker_id":"3936836","broker_name":"Realty Executives Associates ","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":null,"office_mls_set":"O-KXTN-3239","office_name":"Realty Executives Associates Downtown, LLC","office_email":null,"office_phones":[{"number":"8653472482","type":null,"primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"Tn School For Deaf, Knox County School District","primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m3124581475od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m3124581475od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m1779635279od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m3080782507od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m3616972842od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m2018534285od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m1024037605od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m169450882od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m832404281od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m257700350od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m3750730570od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m661765878od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m2294685639od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m1851314561od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m3728894060od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m2456308590od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m1798845642od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/ab6d8d3574d6fd95c460f038b9e4e35cl-m3066553729od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/2001-Cherokee-Bluff-Dr_Knoxville_TN_37920_M72570-05693","property_id":"7257005693","listing_id":"2975003499","mls":"GSTN","mls_id":"303857","status":"SOLD","text":"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION.

OPPORTUNITY TO OWN A HOME IN LAKEMOOR HILLS---IYKYK. Lakemoor Hills is a hidden gem of a community located in a fantastic SOUTH KNOXVILLE location on a BOULEVARD and on the DOGWOOD TRAIL. It's rare that a home comes on the market here. This home was once owned by a MASTER GARDENER who left a detailed map of all the flowers & plantings she installed (23 varieties of Iris; 9 Peony, multiple types of daylillies, fig trees & more) . This basement ranch has been mostly updated. It has a great OPEN FLOOR PLAN that's surprising for a home of this age. The GOURMET KITCHEN was updated in 2018 with GRANITE TOPS (Normandy by Triton Stone), a GAS COOKTOP, THE PAINTED ROOM REMASTERED CABINETRY, new lighting, and updated APPLIANCES and an ITALIAN EXHAUST SYSTEM. (the REFRIGERATOR was installed in 11\/24). There are DOUBLE PANTRIES too. This home offers several options for dining including BREAKFAST BAR, formal dining space & an eat-in kitchen. Master main. Huge en suite. MAIN LEVEL MASTER suite is HUGE. The Master Suite features an en suite with WALK IN SHOWER, CORK FLOORING, updated vanity and CUSTOM CLOSET ORGANIZATION UNITS. The Master has MULTIPLE CLOSETS and an entrance on to the DECK overlooking the TREE LINED back yard. My favorite room---and the favorite of the current owner is the YEAR ROUND SUNROOM. All kinds of natural light streams through the windows and allows for a view of the grounds. Need STORAGE? There's an entire room dedicated to it downstairs, built-in cabinetry, lots of closets, and space in the attic. There's also an enviable POTTING SHED (or storage shed) that comes with the home. DOWNSTAIRS there are 2 bedrooms and a full bath in the FULLY FINISHED WALK OUT BASEMENT. There's also a KITCHEN IN THE BASEMENT----think rental potential (medical residents at UT Hospital, travelling nurses, grad students). The details: the HVAC is updated with the upper unit being NEW IN 2024 & the lower level in 2017. The home has updated ANDERSEN DOUBLE HUNG WINDOWS. Septic system was cleaned out about 6 months ago. There's a RADON MITIGATION SYSTEM IN PLACE and the GUTTERS REPLACED WITH OVERSIZED DOWNSPOUTS. DECKING & RAILINGS have also been updated. There was a FENCING installed in 2024. Russell's Pest control maintains the Centricon system. Let's talk about this well-connected community of a subdivision. There are: GARDEN CLUBS; PICKLEBALL CLUBS; PICINIC\/BICYCLE PARADES; WALKING TRAIL; LENDING LIBRARIES; A WELCOME COMMITTEE; BOOK CLUB; MONTHLY SOCIAL HOURS; COOKOUTS and more. The home's ORIGINAL BLUEPRINTS will be left for the its new owners along with the detailed garden map.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"3516 Bluff Point Dr","street":"3516 Bluff Point

you pull up to this beautiful basement rancher, one of the first things you will notice will be the brick all on the outside of the home. It comes from the historical Roxy Theater from downtown Knoxville; how cool to own a special piece of history! When you open the front door into the foyer, you will be greeted with a warn and comfortable feeling. You will see that the floors are sawn oak and the large majority of the trim is mahogany wood. To the right is a large living room with lots of natural lighting and beautiful hardwood floors. Don't forget to take a peek at the pictures on the wall of the azaleas in bloom! The wood burning fireplace is great for those cozy winter evenings while reading a good book. The family dining room off the living room also has beautiful natural lighting coming through the big window and is ready to host all your family & friends game nights! The kitchen has been totally remodeled, giving it a fresh, modern and farmhouse feel. It even includes an induction cooktop and oven that can be a double oven. Right off of the kitchen, you will be able to enjoy your football game days, family movie nights, and relaxing morning coffee on the screened in porch. As you move on down the hallway, you'll be greeted with 3 bedrooms and a refinished full bathroom in hallway. One of the bedrooms is the primary that has its own private bathroom. Once ready to go down the stairs to the basement, you'll see a great big playroom and additional living area that will give you the luxury of relaxing while watching your kids play. (Even includes a custom play home built-in to the stairs!). But that's not all- there is another room, that could be used as an office, bedroom, or anything you'd like. On the opposite side of basement, there is ample storage space and a workshop for all your creative ideas. And it all fits on a half acre, wooded, private yard! This home is centrally located in South Knoxville with plenty of shopping, restaurants, and things to do nearby!","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"213 Beechwood Dr","street":"213 Beechwood

HOA!!! NO RESTRICTIONS!!! Welcome to 3600 Timberlake Drivea fully renovated 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home on 2.37 acres that blends thoughtful design with premium upgrades, located in a desirable neighborhood with a voluntary HOA. This home is listed well below a recent appraisal, offering exceptional value for a move-in-ready property that has already been updated from top to bottom. From the moment you step inside, you'll notice the attention to detail, starting with a completely transformed kitchen. The once-enclosed galley space is now open to the living and dining areas, thanks to the removal of a dividing wall and all-new framing, insulation, and drywall. The kitchen features custom cabinetry, sleek new countertops, and modern appliancesincluding a convection stove and a vent hood that exhausts directly outside. Plumbing and wiring have been entirely replaced, and a tankless water heater now serves the home. Recessed lighting and accent fixtures create a warm, inviting atmosphere throughout the main living spaces. The kitchen was also extended to include custom pantry cabinetry, and it now features a Radiant Life 14-stage biocompatible drinking water filtration system, which removes contaminants such as PFOAs, fluoride, medications, lead, and pesticides, while reintroducing essential minerals for optimal health. Beyond the kitchen, the living space continues to impress. Wood paneling on the fireplace has been replaced with beautiful real stone, and the wall between the dining room and sunroom was refinished with drywall and detailed trim for a polished look. Fresh paint throughout most of the home and high-end luxury vinyl plank flooring in the main living areas and guest bedroom give the space a fresh, modern feel, while the master bedroom features soft new carpet. A new step from the back door to the sunroom enhances the home's indoor-outdoor connection. Functionally, the layout has been improved with a newly added wall and double doors separating the kitchen from the bedroom hallway. Doorways were reconfigured for better flow, and the guest bathroom now includes an exterior vent, all new cabinet and drawer fronts, and updated hardware. The plumbing from this bathroom to the septic tank was inspected and remains in excellent condition. Outdoors, the home continues to shine. The entire back deck and its supporting structure were replaced, and the saltwater pool's filter received fresh sand this month. Tile on the pool's fountain feature was also repaired or replaced. Electrical upgrades include code-compliant wiring from the workshop (that has a mini-split) to the garage, and a 450V RV outlet added to the garage's exterior wall. The possibilities are endless. Other key updates include termite treatment and certification, preventive carpenter bee treatment, and a septic tank pump-out upon move-in. For future convenience, custom-made closet door wood runners were also prepared and kept on hand. This home is the full packagestylishly updated, structurally improved, and meticulously maintainedin a peaceful setting. Located minutes from downtown Knoxville and convenient to Alcoa Hwy and Blount Co. Move in and enjoy the benefits of a home that's already been upgraded from the inside out.

The large stone gas fireplace works well and gives off lots of heat. Split floor plan with a 2nd bedroom and full bathroom, next to the laundry room. There are 2 garages on this level. Let's go back to the primary bathroom - features a walk-in large shower, double vanities, cedar hot rock sauna, huge air-jet bathtub with rock surround and multi-colored lights plus room on the side for beverages and bath bombs ;-). It is a must for reducing stress! A full apartment is downstairs with its own driveway and 2 garages for complete independence.

Room for a kitchen table, and a den for television watching. All tile flooring downstairs. 2nd garage even has a sunken safe which we've never used! The 1.87 acre land is beautiful! New wooden porches on the front and back with cable railing so your view is not compromised. A video is attached with a walk-through of the property and tree identification. So many blooms right now, and plenty of shade. Then in the backyard, we have what we call 'the backyard creek'! It's a custom built rock water feature that soothes your soul. And it's on a flagstone patio with lighting all around for your patio furniture. Also in the backyard is an old cabin that a previous owner built for his kids! The property line goes up to the top of the hill and that's where the fence extends to as well. Plenty of room for running! In the back yard, there is a storage shed with inside storage and lighting, and also a carport for your lawnmower. We've added a 30 amp plug for your camper and a gravel driveway with a large gate. Amerigas leased 500 gallon propane tank with automatic service for fill ups if you desire. Two HVAC units, one for each level. The basement HVAC has a dehumidifier so no more worrying about moisture! Both units purchased 9 years ago. The location is great - 1 mile from South Doyle High School and 1\/2 mile from Bonny Kate Elementary.

Fun-Loving Human\/Crew Ready to Move In and Chill copy\/paste for my full profile video!! South Knoxville|Zero HOA Drama +100% Main Character Energy I'm looking for someone who appreciates nice lines, good lighting, and a layout that flows. If you like things that are move-in ready, modern-but-cozy, and full of practical perks (with a little bit of sass), we might be soulmates. Here's what I bring to the table: LVP floors, crown molding, and neutral paint throughoutyes, even in the garage, because I don't slack on the details. Plantation shutters on all windows for that touch of sophistication and extra privacy for all your people-watching shenanigans. Tankless water heater because you deserve hot water happiness. Massive, open living room perfect for birthday blowouts, Netflix marathons, or just chillin' in style. Split-bedroom layout so everyone gets their own space and you don't hear your teenager's music through the wall. #boundaries Kitchen with granite counters, pantry, and fancy touches like a touchless faucet and actual Starbucks-style glass sprayerso yes, you now run a coffee shop and live in it too. Primary bedroom the size of a small kingdomking bed, oversized dresser, pack-n-play, yoga mat, desk... bring it all. Ensuite bathroom giving you that Pinterest glow-up: new shiplap, dual sinks, walk-in tiled shower, and mirror lighting that creates picture perfect selfies for your socials. Walk-in closet that deserves its own fan club. No HOA. No city taxes. Just peace, quiet, and convenience! If you're looking for a home that's got the updates, the space, and the ''wow'' without the workI'm right here. Don't ghost me. Let's make it official.
