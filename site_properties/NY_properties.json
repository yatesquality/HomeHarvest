Some homes are mere spaces-walls and windows and doors-but others are stories waiting to be told, whispered into existence by the light that spills through their rooms, by the quiet that lingers in their corners, by the fire that crackles in their hearths. This Gramercy Park penthouse is such a home, a place suspended between the past and the possible, perched atop a boutique prewar building as if it has always been here, waiting. High above the city's hum, wrapped in an enormous terrace that catches the sun's first light and the hush of twilight, this is a home for dreamers. Two wood-burning fireplaces flicker with the warmth of a hundred unwritten tales. Ceilings stretch tall, welcoming breath and thought alike, while every room is bathed in a golden glow that shifts with the turning of the hours. A vast eat-in kitchen stands at the heart of it all, a place where meals become moments, where coffee and conversation weave their own quiet magic. The two bedrooms offer sanctuary, while a windowed home office gazes out upon the world, a space for work, for words, for wandering minds. Two full baths, serene and still, wait to wash away the day. And always, there is the hush-Gramercy's rarest gift, the quiet that belongs only to those who have found a way to live above it all. Beyond your door, Gramercy Park unfolds-a neighborhood steeped in history, wrapped in elegance, pulsing with the energy of the city's finest restaurants, boutiques, and cultural corners. Madison Square Park, Union Square, and the Greenmarket are mere steps away, vibrant and ever-changing, yet constant in their charm. At 102 East 22nd, life is curated with care. This boutique prewar building offers on-site laundry, a bike room, and the ever-watchful presence of a live-in superintendent. Pets are welcomed, as is co-purchasing, because a home like this should be shared-with those you love, with those who visit, with those who have always belonged within its walls. Some homes are spaces. Others are stories. Perhaps, if you listen closely, this one is already whispering yours.","style":"COOP","full_street_line":"102 E 22nd St # B","street":"102 E 22nd St","unit":"# B","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip_code":"10010","beds":2,"full_baths":null,"half_baths":null,"sqft":null,"year_built":1928,"days_on_mls":89,"list_price":1750000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-02-07","sold_price":2050000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-07","assessed_value":null,"estimated_value":null,"tax":null,"tax_history":null,"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":null,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":40.739128,"longitude":-73.986435,"neighborhoods":"Midtown Manhattan, Gramercy Park","county":"New York","fips_code":"36061","stories":10,"hoa_fee":3061,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"2279164","agent_name":"Josh Rubin","agent_email":"JRubin@elliman.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"9177276321"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Direct","number":"2123217111"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-DENY-JBR","agent_nrds_id":null,"broker_id":"2277901","broker_name":"Douglas Elliman NYC ","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"2277890","office_mls_set":"O-DENY-77","office_name":"111 Fifth","office_email":"lead.manager@elliman.com","office_phones":[{"number":"2126454040","type":"Office","primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"SUCCESS ACADEMY CHARTER SCHOOL-UNION SQUARE, New York City Geographic District #

Gracious proportions and ceilings ranging up to approximately 10'3 set the awe-inspiring stage for world-renowned designer Thierry Despont to craft residences with many custom elements typically reserved for privately commissioned homes. These museum-quality finishes coalesce with expressive architecture by Pritzker Prize-winner Jean Nouvel to create singular spaces of unsurpassed grandeur and elegance in both scale and proportion. From the formal entry gallery, the generous corner living room is lined with floor-to-ceiling windows that artfully frame south- and east-facing views. The windowed custom kitchen by Thierry Despont for Molteni features polished statuary marble countertops and a back-lit statuary marble backsplash that complement back-painted glass cabinetry with polished nickel detailing and Dornbracht fixtures. The extensive suite of appliances by Miele and Sub-Zero includes a fully integrated refrigerator and freezer, five-burner cooktop with fully vented hood, integrated dishwasher, wall oven, speed oven, under-counter wine refrigerator, and integrated coffee maker. The primary suite offers east-facing views, a generous walk-in closet and spa-like ensuite bathroom that blends tradition with originality. Elegantly appointed in polished Noir St. Laurent marble, high-honed Verona limestone, and polished Persian golden travertine with polished nickel Dornbracht fixtures throughout, the primary bathroom features two separate custom carved vanities with custom Thierry Despont-designed polished nickel automated mirrors, a cast iron Lefroy Brooks soaking tub, freestanding shower, radiant heated floors, private water closet with commode and bidet, and a large linen closet. A gracious secondary bedroom enjoys east-facing views and offers an en suite bathroom clad in high-honed Verona limestone with polished nickel Dornbracht fixtures. Completing the residence are a beautifully appointed powder room and a discreet utility closet with side-by-side washer and vented dryer. No detail has been overlooked, from the custom interior lighting design by Thierry Despont in collaboration with Schwinghammer, to the motorized Lutron solar shades throughout with additional blackout shades in each bedroom, to the supply of humidified and filtered fresh air throughout the home. 53 West 53 is a sculptural icon, rising 1, 050 feet in the heart of Manhattan against the cinematic backdrop of Central Park and the surrounding cityscape. Designed to be responsive to residents in every way, 53 West 53 offers 30, 000 square feet of amenities and five-star hotel-level service, bringing an unprecedented level of access and refinement to the residential experience.
