Encased in glass and immersed in nature, it offers a rare stillness. This is not merely a home, but a retreat one that knows exactly what it is. Golden light pours through expansive windows in clean, radiant streaks, illuminating every corner. The newly reimagined kitchen is a study in understated elegance: grounded by sleek countertops, refined finishes, new appliances, and a deep, walk-in pantry, it's equally suited to the rituals of daily living and long, leisurely meals. A singular round window becomes its own art, framing a view that stretches from the velvet green hills to the faraway shimmer of the city below. Downstairs, the bedrooms are tucked quietly into the hillside, creating a serene, almost meditative escape. The primary suite offers a private terrace and ensuite bath, in an intimate setting for quiet mornings accompanied by birdsong. A second bedroom opens to its own balcony, where sunrises and sunsets become part of the daily rhythm. The garage is more than functional, a flexible space, a studio, a workspace, a gym. The home sits near iconic Mulholland Drive and the creative enclave of Laurel Canyon, with the shops and cafes of Studio City minutes away. Yet it exists entirely in its own world: a rarefied perch above the fray, offering solitude without seclusion. This is a home for those who seek more than square footage. It is for those who crave connection to the land. The kind of place that makes you pause. Breathe. And know you've found something unique.

The kitchen has granite counters and shaker cabinetry. Both bathrooms were recently remodeled. The bedrooms have ample closets--a huge walk-in in one.

Located near the end of a quiet cul-de-sac and part of the Upper Nichols Canyon Modern Residential Historic District, this is the first time this property has been available in 57 years. This historic home has several original architectural elements including an atrium entryway with expansive skylights, walls of glass including interior and exterior clerestory windows, and several original built-in post & beam decorative features in the kitchen, living room, entry, and bedrooms. Thoughtfully designed with an open floorplan, the large gourmet kitchen has a vaulted ceiling, clerestory windows and a peninsula counter opening to the dining and living rooms, with floor-to-ceiling walls of glass that highlight views of Briar Summit Open Space Preserve and sliding glass doors to the peaceful backyard and garden. The property has 3 bedrooms, three baths, plus a large bonus room that can be used as an office, den, or fourth bedroom. The primary suite has direct access to the backyard, floor-to-ceiling glass on two sides, and interior clerestory windows over the closet, providing abundant light in both the bedroom and living room and allowing natural light to filter through the entire home. The private, sunny backyard is thoughtfully landscaped and has room for a pool. Historic Upper Nichols Canyon, with wide streets, sidewalks, and buried power lines, is conveniently located just off Mulholland Drive, near the geographic center of Los Angeles and minutes away from dining, shopping, and studios in Hollywood, Studio City, and Burbank. Some photos are virtually staged to show property potential.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"7545 Kimdale Ln","street":"7545 Kimdale Ln","unit":null,"city":"Los Angeles","state":"CA","zip_code":"90046","beds":3,"full_baths":3,"half_baths":null,"sqft":2488,"year_built":1957,"days_on_mls":44,"list_price":2195000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-03-26","sold_price":2360000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-09","assessed_value":210495,"estimated_value":2210200,"tax":3008,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":3008,"assessment":{"building":115342,"land":95153,"total":210495}},{"year":2023,"tax":2962,"assessment":{"building":113081,"land":93288,"total":206369}},{"year":2022,"tax":2869,"assessment":{"building":110864,"land":91459,"total":202323}},{"year":2021,"tax":2819,"assessment":{"building":108691,"land":89666,"total":198357}},{"year":2020,"tax":2771,"assessment":{"building":107577,"land":88747,"total":196324}},{"year":2019,"tax":2677,"assessment":{"building":105468,"land":87007,"total":192475}},{"year":2018,"tax":2581,"assessment":{"building":103400,"land":85301,"total":188701}},{"year":2017,"tax":2531,"assessment":{"building":101373,"land":83629,"total":185002}},{"year":2016,"tax":2414,"assessment":{"building":99386,"land":81990,"total":181376}},{"year":2015,"tax":2382,"assessment":{"building":97894,"land":80759,"total":178653}},{"year":2014,"tax":2399,"assessment":{"building":95977,"land":79178,"total":175155}},{"year":2013,"tax":2393,"assessment":{"building":95544,"land":78821,"total":174365}},{"year":2012,"tax":2397,"assessment":{"building":93671,"land":77276,"total":170947}},{"year":2010,"tax":2365,"assessment":{"building":91835,"land":75761,"total":167596}},{"year":2009,"tax":2278,"assessment":{"building":91149,"land":75195,"total":166344}},{"year":2008,"tax":2190,"assessment":{"building":89575,"land":73897,"total":163472}},{"year":2007,"tax":2112,"assessment":{"building":87819,"land":72449,"total":160268}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":7462,"price_per_sqft":949,"latitude":34.125406,"longitude":-118.361485,"neighborhoods":"Nichols Canyon, Hollywood Hills West, Central LA","county":"Los Angeles","fips_code":"06037","stories":1,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":2,"agent_id":"283190","agent_name":"Kevin Keyser","agent_email":"kevin.keyser@sothebys.realty","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"3107247000"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"3238772040"},{"ext":null,"primary":false,"type":"Fax","number":"3102050809"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-WECA-X70746","agent_nrds_id":"175516433","broker_id":null,"broker_name":null,"builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"47674","office_mls_set":"O-WECA-X70275","office_name":"Sotheby's International Realty - Beverly Hills Brokerage","office_email":"Michael.Williamson@sothebyshomes.com","office_phones":[{"number":"3107247000","type":"Office","primary":true,"ext":null},{"number":"3107247010","type":"Fax","primary":false,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"Los Angeles Unified School District","primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/71e5ff8b8f39ddebfe5ecc15f0d21b1el-b4258970878od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/71e5ff8b8f39ddebfe5ecc15f0d21b1el-b4258970878od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/2126-Pelham-Ave_Los-Angeles_CA_90025_M23367-50305","property_id":"2336750305","listing_id":"2979069036","mls":"WECA","mls_id":"25507661","status":"SOLD","text":"Welcome to 2126 Pelham Ave, a stunning and prestigious masterpiece located in the desirable Westwood area.

Arensberg Estate, William Lee Woollett with later contributions by Richard Neutra, Gregory Ain, Henry Palmer Sabin and John Lautner (The only project on record where all these architectural giants have collaborated). Avant-garde art patrons Walter and Louise Arensberg purchased the estate in 1927, transforming it into a modern art museum. Los Angeles Magazine acknowledges that this home represented the first modern art museum in L.A., decades before LACMA and MOCA. The Arensbergs hosted artist exchanges and exhibited prized works by Marcel Duchamp, Rene Magritte, Salvador Dali, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso and Piet Mondrian to name a few. The estate and its art history is the subject of a Getty published book in 2020, Hollywood Arensberg . Sabin's 1928 Neo-classical entry pavilion was designed to house Brancusi's Princess X and Arch . Neutra's 1933 sunlit gallery showcased Duchamp's stained glass and other artworks. Ain's 1936 second-floor gallery introduced a floating soffit ceiling for displaying fine rugs and paintings. In 1954, after Walter Arensberg's death, the estate passed to art dealer Earl Stendahl, who hired Lautner to design a new driveway and carport. Now a designated Los Angeles Historic Monument (#994) and currently protected under the Mills Act, the estate underwent an extensive $5 million restoration between 2018 and 2022 under its current owners. Douglas Levine and Jonathan Browning redesigned the millwork, furniture, and decoration, seamlessly blending historic preservation with modern enhancements, including solar panels and a Control4 smart system. The front garden features a custom 4'x12' concrete table and a 6' black bowl fountain, both by Concreteworks. Two caryatid statues from the 1912 Vanderbilt Hotel, Bacchus and Ariadne, sit within the outdoor garden. A sunken U-shaped seating area surrounds a lawn, ideal for entertaining. The grand brick stairway was restored, with birds of paradise planted in keeping with historical photographs. An auto turntable was installed for convenient entry and exit. The front terrace, restored with custom tile, features Italian umbrellas with built-in LED lighting. Inside, the Brancusi entryway features custom Jonathan Browning lighting. The living room includes custom furniture, four bisque porcelain ceiling fixtures, and a floating steel 'slipcover' fireplace. The dining room boasts a green mohair sofa in a gumwood niche, two mahogany and formica tables, a pendant light, a travertine console from the 1970s, and cocktail tables. The original Butler's Pantry was restored, while the kitchen was transformed from four small rooms into a spacious culinary area. The breakfast room, previously an office, can serve as a bedroom for a personal assistant or nanny. The black powder room, clad in Italian black marble with mirrored walls, features a rare Aldo Tura chandelier. The Neutra-designed room retains its battleship gray linoleum, plaster walls, and restored steel casement windows. The media room, designed by Ain, preserves its original black linoleum and floating soffit ceiling. The staircase showcases 11 rare 1950s Venini light fixtures from a Venetian bank designed by Luigi Nervi. The bedrooms contain custom furniture, floating steel elements, oak built-ins, and Jonathan Browning lighting. The library, with restored original bookcases, now extends onto a newly added terrace.

BY APPT ONLY. This stunning view estate-type property was designed by Arlos R. Sedgley AIA (architect of Greystoke Cottage in Bel Air for director John Farrow and actress Maureen O'Sullivan) and is located just north of Mulholland Drive on over a half-acre of lush and manicured grounds. From its balanced exterior and interior layout to notable design elements, Millbrook exemplifies the elegance of classic Georgian Regency architecture, carefully updated to provide the comforts of modern day living. The property is gated and private, with green space and sunlit views from nearly every vantage point. Highlights include columns on the front portico, Chippendale balcony railings, bow windows, dentil crown moulding, and wainscoting in the entry foyer, dining and living rooms. A thoughtfully renovated spacious and open kitchen features fully-inset custom cabinetry, island seating, and a built-in banquette dining area over Regency style black and white checkerboard floors. A glamorous butler's pantry continues the theme with mirror patina built-ins, silver sink, and luxurious marble countertops. The main entry foyer envelops guests in natural, textured Phillip Jeffries wall covering that wraps around the stairwell leading to the second floor landing. Upstairs are two ensuite bedrooms, nearly symmetrical and across the hall from each other. The ample primary has a windowed sitting area and beautifully remodeled bathroom with Michael Smith fixtures and classic Calacatta marble finishes. The second bedroom is of nearly equal size, with outsized views of the San Gabriel Mountains. Both rooms share a covered sleeping porch with views. On the main level, the living room is perfectly sited to soak in panoramic 180 degree skyline and city light views. Completing the main level are a well-appointed third ensuite bedroom with Ann Sacks tile, office with views (easily converted to a fourth bedroom), and vibrant, jewel box guest bathroom. A lower level family room, 3\/4 bath, and soundproof bonus room round out the home's livable space. Also on this level is the IT room, a wetbar, and large laundry and utility room with ample storage. No corner of this glorious, well loved home is untouched. Improvements include all copper plumbing and a recently lined sewer lateral and new trenchless sewer line, newer roof, newer HVAC motor, upgraded electrical, resurfaced chimneys, and video security camera system. The garage has been fully insulated. Enjoy more views from the front balcony. Additional outdoor features include an outdoor pergola with fireplace, barbecue and seating area, gated side yard for pets, open air veranda with views, large grassy lawn, and pickleball \/ sports court. NOTE: Fourth bedroom, with built-in closets, currently set up as office on main floor, and easily converted to a bedroom. Square footage on public record shows as 3138 sf.

Three stories of living space incorporate a spacious two-story entry that opens to Gatsbyesque living and dining rooms magnificently detailed in the Tudor\/Craftsman Style. Eight bedrooms, and six baths, provide privacy and enough space for a large family, multi-generational living, a private foundation, or museum. A thorough renovation in 2018 included an updated kitchen, 2 baths, and many systems.

The spacious living room with a sliding glass door opens up to the large backyard with exceptional privacy, perfect for entertaining. The laundry is conveniently located inside. This unit is in the middle of the community shielding it from traffic noise one might experience while living directly on Western Avenue. You will not believe how quiet it is until you visit. HOA pays for the water. This is one of the few units with a 2-car garage, other units share a garage. Other units are condos. This feels like a single-family home. The garden-like community is very well kept with its lush landscaping and community pool. Conveniently located near Charles Wilson Park, grocery stores, shopping stores (Del Amo Mall, Target, Marshalls, etc.), and within minutes from the 110 or the 405 freeway.

exceptional, grand-scale Arts & Crafts one-story bungalow on an oversized lot is on the market for the first time in over 35 years. Intact architecturally, this home is exuberant and eclectic, with a rare character seldom seen in L.A. The exterior boldly evokes the Chicago\/Oak Park Prairie Arts & Crafts Movement, with its horizontal band of original stucco and generous use of tan brick, accented with inset tiles. Its roofline boasts flared gables and uniquely shaped eaves with internal gutters. The wide and welcoming front porch and substantial Craftsman front door with inset stained glass open to a stunning interior with extensive wood moldings in all rooms and hardwood floors throughout. Step into the dramatic living room, which features high ceilings and a massive tile fireplace. Flanking the living room is a dining room on one side and a library\/study on the other. These rooms open to each other through columns and bi-fold doors, spanning 50+ feet across the entire front of the home, showcasing the stunning richness of the Arts & Crafts style. The generous sized dining room features a built-in china buffet cabinet, French doors to a side terrace, and a beautiful bay of windows. The library includes bookcases flanking a second art tile fireplace, and access through more French doors to an enclosed porch sunroom with an extensive amount of colorful, geometric-patterned stained and leaded glass that matches the front door. The kitchen was rebuilt with new cabinetry in a period style but with a festive flair, red quartz countertops, custom-patterned linoleum flooring, subway tile walls, and a tin ceiling (with both modern inset lighting and period-style deco lighting). Additionally, there are spacious pantries and a laundry room. Two large bedrooms with walk-in closets share an original subway-tiled bathroom with built-in cabinets, vintage pedestal sink, tub, and separate tiled shower. The third bedroom (former maids quarters) has another walk-in closet and access to a second charming bathroom with clawfoot tub. Residence was seismically upgraded in 1995; the concrete foundation was bolted and plywood cripple walls added with permit. The front yard was professionally landscaped; the ample rear yard has a large pergola seating area, fruit trees, flowering vines and a bamboo forest. The original garage has been converted to a guest house (not included in the square footage of the home's living space). This vintage (c. 1915) home is substantially move-in condition and has central heat and air, but there are some unfinished restoration projects and some deferred maintenance. Current interior wall treatment reflects the longtime owners' creative styles and a new owner may wish to apply their own palette. The property is freeway close, and some traffic noise (particularly outside) is to be expected. Conveniently located in Arlington Heights north of the 10 freeway and walking distance to Surfas chef's store and Truffle Bros.' Spaccio Salumeria cafe; close to all the great new West Adams restaurants.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"2200 4th Ave","street":"2200 4th Ave","unit":null,"city":"Los Angeles","state":"CA","zip_code":"90018","beds":3,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":null,"sqft":2218,"year_built":1915,"days_on_mls":45,"list_price":1350000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-03-28","sold_price":1340000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-12","assessed_value":331128,"estimated_value":1295566,"tax":4354,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":4354,"assessment":{"building":36773,"land":294355,"total":331128}},{"year":2023,"tax":4279,"assessment":{"building":36052,"land":288584,"total":324636}},{"year":2022,"tax":4095,"assessment":{"building":35346,"land":282926,"total":318272}},{"year":2021,"tax":4032,"assessment":{"building":34653,"land":277379,"total":312032}},{"year":2020,"tax":4067,"assessment":{"building":34298,"land":274535,"total":308833}},{"year":2019,"tax":3918,"assessment":{"building":33626,"land":269152,"total":302778}},{"year":2018,"tax":3794,"assessment":{"building":32967,"land":263875,"total":296842}},{"year":2017,"tax":3717,"assessment":{"building":32321,"land":258701,"total":291022}},{"year":2016,"tax":3612,"assessment":{"building":31688,"land":253629,"total":285317}},{"year":2015,"tax":3561,"assessment":{"building":31213,"land":249820,"total":281033}},{"year":2014,"tax":3583,"assessment":{"building":30602,"land":244927,"total":275529}},{"year":2013,"tax":3577,"assessment":{"building":30464,"land":243821,"total":274285}},{"year":2012,"tax":3622,"assessment":{"building":29867,"land":239041,"total":268908}},{"year":2010,"tax":3559,"assessment":{"building":29282,"land":234354,"total":263636}},{"year":2009,"tax":3429,"assessment":{"building":29064,"land":232603,"total":261667}},{"year":2008,"tax":3289,"assessment":{"building":28563,"land":228585,"total":257148}},{"year":2007,"tax":3178,"assessment":{"building":28003,"land":224103,"total":252106}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":10507,"price_per_sqft":604,"latitude":34.037014,"longitude":-118.320855,"neighborhoods":"Central LA, Arlington Heights","county":"Los Angeles","fips_code":"06037","stories":1,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"1251500","agent_name":"DAVID RAPOSA","agent_email":"daveraposa@aol.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Home","number":"(213) 747-1337"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-WECA-L10292","agent_nrds_id":null,"broker_id":null,"broker_name":null,"builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":null,"office_mls_set":"O-WECA-L02857","office_name":"City Living Realty","office_email":null,"office_phones":[{"number":"(213) 747-1337","type":"Office","primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"Los Angeles Unified School District","primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/f9a75ae18f58f837baf4aaa0105a1dbbl-m724991405od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/f9a75ae18f58f837baf4aaa0105a1dbbl-m724991405od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/11542-Burbank-Blvd-Unit-10_North-Hollywood_CA_91601_M26775-08859","property_id":"2677508859","listing_id":"2980410651","mls":"WECA","mls_id":"25523442","status":"SOLD","text":"Welcome to this beautifully updated 2-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom townhome, complete with a versatile 3rd BONUS ROOM and an attached 2-car garage.

You will need to check with the city regarding building an ADU. Property has nice tenants and they take pride in living here which is obvious by how nice it looks. Surrounded by lovely, well manicured bushes and green grass. This would be a great opportunity for anyone wanting to grow their real estate portfolio. Please do not disturb the occupants.","style":"MULTI_FAMILY","full_street_line":"10846 S Manhattan Pl","street":"10846 S Manhattan Pl","unit":null,"city":"Los
