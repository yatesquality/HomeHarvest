This house boasts top of the line carpet and padding in the living room, dining room, and hallway and new flooring in the kitchen. A new roof was put on in September of 2024. Both the warranties for the flooring and the roof are transferrable. The windows have been updated from the original. It also boasts a nice sized, fenced in back yard with a covered patio.

Step into a lovely open floorpan on the main level with wood floors, a formal dining room, and open living, kitchen, and breakfast nook. (Wait till you see the pantry!) Enter from the spacious three-car garage into a mud area with a coat closet and built-in storage nook for boots and backpacks. Upstairs you'll find four bedrooms, three full bathrooms, and the laundry room. The oversized primary bedroom features a luxurious en-suite bath with a generous tile shower, garden tub, double, counter-height sinks, and a large walk-in closet. The laundry room adjoins the primary suite, so no need to lug laundry baskets up and down the stairs. In the basement, you'll find a cozy family room, the fifth bedroom with egress window, and the fourth full bathroom. There is also a large unfinished storage area. Other notable aspects of this home are a radon mitigation system, fresh exterior paint in 2023, and a brand-new roof in September of 2024. The Ridge is located across the street from Lansing High School, features sidewalks throughout the neighborhood, and has a neighborhood pool and play area.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"805 Canyon Ln","street":"805 Canyon Ln","unit":null,"city":"Lansing","state":"KS","zip_code":"66043","beds":5,"full_baths":4,"half_baths":1,"sqft":3601,"year_built":2017,"days_on_mls":56,"list_price":510000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-03-24","sold_price":null,"last_sold_date":"2022-05-25","assessed_value":53578,"estimated_value":509000,"tax":7283,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":7283,"assessment":{"building":47519,"land":6059,"total":53578}},{"year":2023,"tax":7005,"assessment":{"building":47519,"land":6059,"total":53578}},{"year":2022,"tax":6739,"assessment":{"building":43597,"land":5141,"total":48738}},{"year":2021,"tax":6601,"assessment":{"building":40538,"land":5141,"total":45679}},{"year":2020,"tax":6345,"assessment":{"building":38077,"land":5141,"total":43218}},{"year":2019,"tax":6233,"assessment":{"building":37260,"land":5141,"total":42401}},{"year":2018,"tax":6006,"assessment":{"building":35742,"land":5141,"total":40883}},{"year":2017,"tax":887,"assessment":{"building":1150,"land":5141,"total":6291}},{"year":2016,"tax":796,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":5364,"total":5364}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":13650,"price_per_sqft":142,"latitude":39.228252,"longitude":-94.912971,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Leavenworth","fips_code":"20103","stories":null,"hoa_fee":42,"parking_garage":3,"agent_id":"4219968","agent_name":"Diana Dodd","agent_email":"dianawdodd@gmail.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"9136822567"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"9109883472"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-KCMO-413516149","agent_nrds_id":"413516149","broker_id":"714283","broker_name":"Reilly Real Estate, LLC","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"118771","office_mls_set":"O-KCMO-RILY","office_name":"Reilly Real Estate, LLC","office_email":"info@reilly.realestate","office_phones":[{"number":"9136822567","type":"Office","primary":true,"ext":null},{"number":"9136820415","type":"Fax","primary":false,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"Ks.
