The open floor plan seamlessly leads you into a modern kitchen, equipped with brand new countertops, a sleek sink, and state-of-the-art stainless steel appliances. For larger gatherings, the separate dining room offers a perfect setting, or you can step out onto the sprawling second-story composite deck through sliding doors. The convenience of main-level laundry is an added bonus to this home. Upstairs, you'll find four spacious bedrooms, each with generous closet space. Both bathrooms feature double vanities, with the primary suite boasting a whirlpool tub and separate shower. The full, unfinished walkout basement with high ceilings awaits your creativity-imagine a second family room, game room, workout area, or an additional bedroom! Roughed-in plumbing is already in place for another bathroom. Outside, the beauty of nature unfolds on the expansive paver patio, complete with a hot tub for ultimate relaxation. This outdoor oasis offers endless possibilities for entertainment. Recent updates include new carpet, paint, light fixtures, countertops, a powder room vanity, toilets, and screens. The home also features a 3-car attached garage and easy access to I-94, making commuting to the Chicagoland area a breeze.

by Meyer & Cook, this classic Center Dutch Colonial blends vintage charm with thoughtful updates-just 9 miles from downtown Chicago on a picturesque, tree-lined street in Oak Park. Step into a gracious foyer and main level where hardwood floors, intricate moldings, and rich architectural details set the tone. French doors lead to a sunroom and a living room anchored by a fireplace and built-in shelving. A separate formal dining room easily seats eight, perfect for gatherings. The 2022 renovated kitchen is a standout, featuring white cabinetry, stainless steel appliances, custom blue Art Deco tile-work, and a breakfast bar that seats four-opening to a cozy seating area for casual lounging. Upstairs, you'll find three spacious bedrooms and a full bath with mosaic tile flooring. The sun-filled primary bedroom opens onto a large private balcony, offering a quiet retreat. The full basement includes a finished rec room, ample storage, and a dedicated workroom. Out back, enjoy a private, fenced-in yard with an expansive deck that seats twelve-ideal for summer entertaining-and a two-car garage. This beautifully updated home sits in a family-friendly neighborhood, steps from Longfellow Park and School, the New Park Community Recreation Center (offering a gym and kids' programming), and just a short walk to the restaurants and shops of Harrison Street. Equidistant to both the Green and Blue Line and with easy access to I-290, this is a rare blend of charm, convenience, and community-truly a destination of grandeur","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"300 Adams St","street":"300 Adams St","unit":null,"city":"Oak Park","state":"IL","zip_code":"60304","beds":3,"full_baths":1,"half_baths":1,"sqft":1610,"year_built":1921,"days_on_mls":39,"list_price":625000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-04-07","sold_price":625000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-16","assessed_value":45000,"estimated_value":614900,"tax":13589,"tax_history":[{"year":2023,"tax":13589,"assessment":{"building":38826,"land":6174,"total":45000}},{"year":2022,"tax":11817,"assessment":{"building":32522,"land":4410,"total":36932}},{"year":2021,"tax":11576,"assessment":{"building":32522,"land":4410,"total":36932}},{"year":2020,"tax":11443,"assessment":{"building":32522,"land":4410,"total":36932}},{"year":2019,"tax":10056,"assessment":{"building":28416,"land":3969,"total":32385}},{"year":2018,"tax":9675,"assessment":{"building":28416,"land":3969,"total":32385}},{"year":2017,"tax":10863,"assessment":{"building":32184,"land":3969,"total":36153}},{"year":2016,"tax":9742,"assessment":{"building":25180,"land":3307,"total":28487}},{"year":2015,"tax":10105,"assessment":{"building":27338,"land":3307,"total":30645}},{"year":2014,"tax":9408,"assessment":{"building":27338,"land":3307,"total":30645}},{"year":2013,"tax":8294,"assessment":{"building":24810,"land":3307,"total":28117}},{"year":2012,"tax":8566,"assessment":{"building":25519,"land":3307,"total":28826}},{"year":2011,"tax":8401,"assessment":{"building":25519,"land":3307,"total":28826}},{"year":2010,"tax":8480,"assessment":{"building":31798,"land":3307,"total":35105}},{"year":2009,"tax":8563,"assessment":{"building":35103,"land":3307,"total":38410}},{"year":2007,"tax":8738,"assessment":{"building":35693,"land":4586,"total":40279}},{"year":2006,"tax":8420,"assessment":{"building":35693,"land":4586,"total":40279}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":4375,"price_per_sqft":388,"latitude":41.878241,"longitude":-87.7823,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Cook","fips_code":"17031","stories":2,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":2,"agent_id":"1497721","agent_name":"Peter Moore","agent_email":"peter.moore@bairdwarner.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"3123719422"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-CHIL-141810","agent_nrds_id":"360563940","broker_id":"3011074","broker_name":"Baird & Warner -

find! Beautiful brick ranch with walk-out basement and split bedroom floor plan in exclusive Hunters Ridge North is on nearly three-quarters of an acre. This sprawling ranch is located on a quiet cul-de-sac and pond! Three bedrooms, two and half baths and an amazing 3 car heated garage, perfect for car enthusiasts. New carpet and fresh paint. The bright sun room boasts pond views, skylights, and brand new windows and carpet. The newly remodeled main level laundry is ready for loads of laundry! The updated hall bath sparkles. The primary bedroom is enhanced by a large walk-in closet and lux bath with a separate shower, soaking tub, double sinks and a water closet. The eat-in kitchen with a breakfast nook has a beautiful new back splash, walk-in pantry, planning desk and more views of the pond. A toasty gas-log fireplace and fresh new carpet are featured in the inviting family room. The flex room can serve as an office or formal sitting area situated directly across from the dining room. The full walkout English basement is a deep pour, has a rough-in, and is ready for finishing to double the living space! The roof is two years young and mechanicals are 6-7 years old.

Also on this date, we're happy to present to you this spacious split-level home in Prairie Pointe of Round Lake. With 3 bedrooms on the 2nd level and a 4th bedroom or office on the lower level, this truly is a one-size-fits-all family home. For you first-timers, buying a home has been known to cause rental AMNESIA and pride of ownership. It's a beautiful condition to have. Main level vaulted ceilings and an open floor plan give the feeling of a much larger home. Having a kitchen with the abundant storage and countertop space that we offer here will be something you appreciate every day and is ideal for when you want to spoil THAT GIRL or guy with a special home-cooked meal. With warmer weather ahead, that memorable meal may taste even better on the patio in the fenced back yard. Life only gets better from here as you welcome the evening in front of the wood-burning fireplace watching your favorite show or team in the lower-level family room. If you get TUNNEL VISION looking at the current finishes of the home, you could miss the amazing possibilities here. With some fresh paint and flooring you can elevate this home to great new heights. Will you choose something neutral or get a little adventurous with STRAWBERRY BUBBLEGUM colors? There's really no wrong choice there because it's your home. The extra sub-basement is partially finished, which is NOT A BAD THING. You'll appreciate having this space for extra storage. Or you may decide to completely finish this area for some added recreational space. This would make an ideal home theater or a swanky SUIT & TIE speakeasy with full bar! An attached garage is another feature that most of the competition doesn't offer at this price and gives you a place to park your family sedan or SPACESHIP COUPE when the weather turns otherworldly. You know that hindsight is 20\/20 and we don't want you to EXPERIENCE any regret when this house sells quickly to someone else. So hop in your car, check your MIRRORS, and head to 25912 W. Brooks Farm as safely and quickly as you can. We look forward to seeing you soon!","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"25912 W Brooks Farm Rd","street":"25912 W Brooks Farm Rd","unit":null,"city":"Round

Scott St., is a 4 bed\/5 bath historic townhouse in the Gold Coast with a private roof deck. Situated on one of the most prestigious residential streets in all of Chicago, first impressions do not disappoint thanks to mature trees, a classic brick-and-limestone exterior, and a cerulean blue front door. The interior footprint begins with an editorial-worthy foyer that flaunts terrazzo floors, an orange blossom wallcovering from Cole & Sons, and a walk-in coat room. First-class fixtures and finishes continue across the main level, beginning with a striking, open-concept living\/dining room with high ceilings and hardwood floors. The street-facing formal living room receives amazing natural light and features meticulous millwork details and a black marble-fronted fireplace while the adjacent dining room finds definition from a statement staircase with original ironwork. Beyond, pocket doors reveal an all-white chef's kitchen with custom cabinetry, gorgeous Lefroy Brooks fittings, a marble waterfall island with counter seating, and professional appliances including a Wolf range, a Sub-Zero refrigerator and a Miele dishwasher. The main level also boasts a passthrough, marble-topped wet bar with slate-colored cabinetry and a wine fridge, a pretty powder room, and a reading den. Upstairs, the second level is devoted to this home's luxe primary suite plus a handsome secondary ensuite bedroom. The finely appointed primary features built-in bookcases, a sitting area, oversize windows with Juliet balconies that frame treetop views, generous walk-in closet area offering multiple closets with antiqued mirror doors, a built-in desk or accessories station, and a stunning ensuite bath with herringbone porcelain tile floors, a dual vanity, a soaking tub, a standalone shower and a separate water closet. The third level presents a lovely gallery hall with skylights that flood the stairwell with natural light, two additional bedrooms that share a full Jack and Jill bath, and access to a 250 square foot roof deck. (Note: The fourth bedroom currently features a built-in wet bar to serve as an upstairs family\/media room, but can be easily converted back to a bedroom based on preference.) Additional callout details include a carefully curated collection of designer light fixtures throughout, a polished mudroom with side-by-side laundry and a wash basin, and a professional security and internet system. Steps from Goudy Square Park, Oak Street Beach, the Division Street Farmers' Market, and a wealth of world-class dining and shopping in the Gold Coast, 30 E. Scott St., is a turnkey home with incomparable style - and the best of Chicago right outside your front door.

Pristinely maintained with soaring ceilings, gleaming hardwood floors, bright tall windows, modern, updated lighting and fans, this space has great flow and is perfect for today's living and entertaining. Gather with your loved ones in the sunlit living area and host your largest holiday gatherings in the oversized dining area without missing any of the action from the oversized kitchen. You'll marvel at this thoughtfully-designed chef's domain boasting miles of granite countertops, loads of custom cherry cabinetry, large range, dual ovens (one electric), range hood, peninsula eating bar, large pantry closet with pull out drawers, small appliance shelves with power, and a custom built-in banquette breakfast area overlooking the deep backyard. Off the living room, tucked away behind barn doors, is a first floor bedroom that could also serve as a family room, play space or home office. The expanded, roomy, spa-like first floor bath with double sinks, an extra long tub and loads of storage is a Zen retreat and perfect for guests or family. A spacious and handy back mudroom completes this level. When you're ready to retire, head upstairs to find three additional bedrooms! Up a half flight of stairs is the first large, sundrenched bedroom with windows on three sides and gorgeous hardwood floors. At the top level you'll find two additional bedrooms, plus a large sitting area. Another beautiful, spa-like bath with a walk in shower completes this level. The bight, clean, dry full basement has tall ceilings, high windows, drain tile and sump pump, a perfect wine cellar, laundry and a workshop area and is ready for your ideas if you need to add additional living space. Outside, you'll find a large deck (with a fun slide!) and a huge, deep, sunlit yard that will make any gardener thrilled. And one parking spot in back with additional parking in driveway means your guests are always welcome. This beautiful home was gutted down to the studs and completely re-envisioned and renovated in 2014. Everything was redone then - first floor opened up; new kitchen; new hardwood floors; new recessed lighting; new light fixtures; enlarged, new first floor bath; new, widened staircase; new upstairs bath; new drywall; new Pella windows; new zoned heating and cooling; new drain tile; new sump-pump; new roof; new siding; new 200A service and new electric panel; new plumbing and so much more. All this in a fantastic River Forest location that's minutes to ice cream, coffee, dining, shopping, gyms, grocery, parks, schools, Metra, and more! This is the one you've been waiting for.

Adjacent to the kitchen, the spacious dining room is perfect for hosting large dinner parties yet inviting enough for everyday meals. Both bathrooms have been completely redesigned, blending modern aesthetics with timeless finishes. Down the hall, you'll find two spacious bedrooms, including a primary suite with an en-suite bath. The third bedroom has been opened up and is currently used as a stylish media room off the front of the home. Step outside and enjoy outdoor living on the generous private deck. The well-maintained building is in strong financial condition, offering peace of mind to homeowners. One outdoor parking space is included. Don't miss this rare opportunity to own a vintage gem in one of Loyola Park's most sought-after locations!","style":"CONDOS","full_street_line":"1325 W Albion Ave Apt 3","street":"1325 W Albion
