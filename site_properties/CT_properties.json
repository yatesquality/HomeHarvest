Franklin and LaGrange are just a short drive away for all your shopping and recreational needs.","style":"LAND","full_street_line":"1 Boggus Rd # D2","street":"1 Boggus Rd","unit":"# D2","city":"Franklin","state":"GA","zip_code":"30217","beds":null,"full_baths":null,"half_baths":null,"sqft":null,"year_built":null,"days_on_mls":154,"list_price":70000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2024-08-15","sold_price":65000,"last_sold_date":"2025-01-16","assessed_value":null,"estimated_value":67000,"tax":null,"tax_history":null,"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":217800,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Heard","fips_code":null,"stories":null,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"4351621","agent_name":"Meredith Green","agent_email":"meredith@atljoe.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":null,"number":"7705608230"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-ASGA-GREENMEREDIT","agent_nrds_id":null,"broker_id":null,"broker_name":null,"builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":null,"office_mls_set":"O-ASGA-DWLI01","office_name":"Dwelli","office_email":"jake@dwelli.com","office_phones":[{"number":"4705054356","type":"Mobile","primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":null,"primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/1dab57ee8ffd26db3586bbcf09c6c325l-m3031535674od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/1dab57ee8ffd26db3586bbcf09c6c325l-m3031535674od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/16849-US-Highway-27_Franklin_GA_30217_M91602-32542","property_id":"9160232542","listing_id":"2975813844","mls":"ASGA","mls_id":"10422293","status":"SOLD","text":"This one-of-a-kind property is brimming with potential!

There's a private well with a new pump, plus county water tie-in available. Fruit trees, blueberry bushes, and a maintained hay field enhance the agricultural value, and the property benefits from a 10-year conservation covenant with three years remaining for significant tax savings. DREAM WORTHY PASTURES! Super Lush pastures provide perfect grazing land for horses, cattle or other livestock. Front pasture has been cultivated for hay production. Round pen (or bullpen) for horse training. Located on a quiet country road in a tight-knit community within a great school district, this move-in ready mini-farm is the perfect blend of privacy, practicality, and rural charm.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"2295 Nutt Rd","street":"2295 Nutt

is a great opportunity to own on over 12 acres in Heard County, this large property offers space, flexibility, and multiple features for a variety of needs.

There are multiple decks and a front porch that spans the full length of the home. The attached four-car garage leads into a dedicated recreation room with a mirrored wall and a separate office space. Additional structures on the property include a detached two-car garage, a feed shed, a well house that could be reconnected for use, and other storage buildings suitable for tractors or recreational vehicles. The property is fully fenced and includes a 1, 500-gallon septic tank with 400 feet of field lines, installed in 2022. Recent updates include two new HVAC units and ductwork added in 2023, gutters on the front of the home, security camera wiring, and a transferable termite bond.
