Very little damage from the 2024 Roswell Flood, as you can see from the original wood flooring that is still in good shape! Basement did fill with water, but has new water heater and HVAC and the den did have some water intrusion, but the wood paneling was not damaged.

opportunity to buy a move-in-ready mobile in the coveted Villa Park senior community. All you need to bring to your new home is your toothbrush, a suitcase of clothes, and a bag of groceries. Fully furnished unit is better than new as it's been meticulously maintained and immensely loved. When you pull up, you'll see a covered front porch, on which you can begin your day with a cup of coffee and end your day with a glass of chardonnay. You'll also notice the carport on the backside, complete with sloping ramp leading to the deck, making access easy for all. Step inside and you will feel warm and fuzzy as the cozy interior wraps its loving arms around you to welcome you home. Updated paint is very stylish and neutral, while the decor is classy and fun. Furnishings are very comfortable and make you want to take your shoes off and stay a while.
