The 2, 668-square-foot floor plan includes three bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, an office, a laundry room on the same level as the bedrooms, and a lower-level one-bedroom\/one-bathroom ADU. Perfect for entertaining, the open-concept living room flows seamlessly with the dining and kitchen areas, yet they feel separate enough for people to have their own space. The chef's kitchen includes a pantry, quartz countertops, an island, a tile backsplash, and a gas range, and it opens up to a breakfast nook space. Appreciate custom design and functional details like a built-in entertainment center, floor-to-ceiling windows, and an entire tiled mosaic wall in the half-bathroom. Escape upstairs to the primary suite featuring a coved ceiling, double doors, double vanity, and an expansive walk-in closet with an organization system. The lower-level ADU has investment potential for the Buyer looking for passive income through short\/long-term rentals or an individual with a steady stream of out-of-town guests who need separate quarters. It has been a successful investment; in 2024, the lower-level unit was occupied by a minimum 30-day renter for 319 days and remains a top home on Airbnb. Buyers and potential renters enjoy the Richmond neighborhood, close to the vibrant Clinton and Division streets, with award-winning restaurants, eclectic shopping, parks, and easy access to main thoroughfares.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"3233 SE 31st Ave","street":"3233 SE 31st

in the treetops along Portlands storied bird migration path, this pristine mid-century treasure is a front-row seat to natures quiet theater. Here, eagles drift past your windows, the forest shifts with the seasons, and the line between indoors and out disappears with a slide of the glass doors. Originally built in 1965 and thoughtfully updated over time, this 2, 672-square-foot home pairs iconic mid-century design with grounded, everyday luxury: heated tile floors, bamboo underfoot, and a rebuilt deck stretching toward the view. Inside, four bedrooms and three baths unfold with warmth and intention, anchored by two fireplacesone gas, one wood-burningand a kitchen now outfitted with Thermador double ovens for modern gathering. Original details remain beautifully intact, from internal wood paneling and period brick to vintage light fixtures, floating toilets, and a built-in GE transistor radio with integrated speaker systemoffering a rare glimpse into the design sensibility of the era. With its clean lines, warm wood tones, and confident simplicity, Don Draper would feel right at homeOld Fashioned in hand. Lovingly maintained, the home is perched on a ridge in Portlands Southwest Hills, where light filters through the trees. Here, life feels more attuned to the rhythm of naturetimeless, quiet, and deeply considered. [Home Energy Score = 9.

The main floors layout opens up opportunities: host friends, work from home, create a playroom, studio, or cozy library. Out back, theres a yard just waiting for a hammock, a garden, or a few summer barbecues. Its big enough to dream in. And the 485-square-foot garage? Lets just say whether you need storage, a workspace, or a place to finally start that hobby youve been putting offits got you covered. Its not perfect, and thats the beauty of it.

house tucked away in the coveted South Hills neighborhood and only a stones throw from grocery stores, vibrant food carts in the Friendly Neighborhood, and Wayne Morse Ranch. The fenced yard and babbling seasonal creek provide beauty, privacy, and tranquility in your own personal oasis. Creek typically runs 10 months out of the year. This bright home boasts large windows that invite you to enjoy views of manicured landscaping, wild woods, and Eugene stretching out below. Over the past five years, sellers updated this home with premium materials with the intention to stay, but unexpected changes necessitated a move. The greater part of the spacious interior offers new flooring and fresh paint, as well as vaulted ceilings and a newly remodeled bathroom with a deep comfy tub. Other upgrades include: large newly remodeled converted office in the garage, level 2 EV charger, new heat pump, new windows, new kitchen appliances, a back deck wired for a hot tub, and a fiber internet network that was recently installed at the street. This urban forested sanctuary is a special place to live. Come and see it for yourself.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"3151 Storey Blvd","street":"3151 Storey

at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, this lovingly maintained single-level has a warmth that makes you instantly feel at home. Fresh interior paint and brand-new carpeting throughout create a welcoming foundation, making it easy to settle in from day one. The kitchen is bright and functional, featuring a brand-new dishwasher, stainless microwave, and ample space for daily living. A full suite of appliancesincluding the refrigerator, washer, and dryerwill stay with the home for a truly seamless move-in experience. Behind the scenes, key systems have been thoughtfully upgraded and well cared for. The HVAC has been recently serviced, attic insulation was added for year-round comfort, and a newer roof (2018), new water main, gutter guards, and a French drain with exterior drainage ensure the property is well protected for the long haul. Outside, the care and attention continues. A $19, 000 professional exterior paint job gives the home crisp curb appeal, and the fully fenced backyard offers both privacy and possibility. The double-tiered retaining wall has been thoughtfully designed with drainage in mind and creates space for a beautifully layered garden. Sweet and sour cherry trees, blueberry bushes, rosemary, lavender, and even a patch of garlic add character and charm, while black-eyed Susans, poppies, daffodils, and tulips bring seasonal color to the landscape. A beautifully tiered garden along the north side of the yard has been thoughtfully planted with native Pacific Northwest favoritesOregon grape, snowberry, sword ferns, Salal, rhododendrons, and vibrant hydrangeascreating a lush, layered backdrop. Two flowering dogwood trees anchor the lower terrace, adding seasonal charm. Baby sequoias, thoughtfully planted 2030 feet from the home, are given ample space to grow without encroaching on the structure. From the backyard, west-facing views open wide to stunning sunsetsmaking evenings here feel truly magical.

energy, bold updates, and a whole lot of heartthis University Park bungalow is more than a home, its a vibe. With 4 true bedrooms, 2 full baths and a fully finished lower level that lives large, Peachy Keen brings the charm and then some. The main level is sun-filled and welcoming, with white oak hardwood floors, a gas fireplace, and a cozy dining nook with built-in benches made for slow mornings. The kitchen features newer appliances and opens up beautifully to a flexy family room with a wood-burning fireplace - aka your next favorite hangout spot. The remodeled main bath is a total retreat, featuring a freestanding slipper tub, heated towel rack, floating vanity and Rejuvenation mirror - pure spa vibes. Every detail was done with care. Downstairs, a full 2021 remodel added two bedrooms with egress windows, LVP flooring, seismic upgrades, and in 2025, a gorgeous second bathroom with laundry. Think: porcelain checkered floors from the WOW Stardust collection, Samsung washer\/dryer, and smart Hue lights to set the mood. The home also includes PEX plumbing, new electrical, AC, Nest thermostat, Google security cameras, solid core interior doors, and Hardy siding (2023). The 10x20 barn-style shed is wired and ready to be powered up for your workshop, studio, or gear drop zone. Outside, youve got three tax lots (55 x 102) of landscaped goodness - lush lawn area, multiple patios, twinkle-lit corners, and even a large chicken coop. Urban farming meets front porch hangs. The corner lot onto an alleyway creates distance from your friendly neighbors. Tucked into a quiet, leafy neighborhood near the University of Portland, with Willamette bluff views, parks galore (hello Arbor Lodge & Columbia) and easy access to the best of Kenton and St. Johns.

to 3833 SW Greenleaf Drive, a distinguished residence with an architectural pedigree of Morris Whitehouse. Here we have a rare combination of a comfortably sized home with the architectural delights usually reserved for larger, grand homes. Whitehouse incorporated the harmony of the Golden Ratio so each room feels comfortable, inviting yet refined while showcasing the gardens in each thoughtfully placed window. Situated on a prime .26 acre lot, the home is surrounded by inviting patios, lush lawns, established landscaping, and a small-batch vineyard. The front door is on SW Labbe, so the back of the home is oriented to the south, providing abundant natural light as well as dazzling sunsets. The attached 2-car garage opens directly into the kitchen, via a mudroom. This home is poised to take advantage of the surrounding gardens at every turn. Extensive updates include a newer (total tear off) roof, tankless hot-water heater, A\/C, gas furnace, sewer line, double-pane windows, updated kitchen and lower level family and bonus\/4th bedroom - non-conforming due to egress window being a few inches too high. Whitehouse designed many schools and public buildings in Portland and Salem including the Historic University Club, Waverly Country Club, Temple Beth Israel, the State Capitol Building in Salem as well as the United States Courthouse in Downtown Portland. Although he was predominantly commissioned for grand commercial edifices, including state buildings and exclusive private clubs, he also valued the opportunity to design distinctive residential homes. Just imagine owning a piece of his remarkable portfolio.The Greenleaf Loop is a favorite for all ages and stages due to the ease of topography and the historic wild roses and wild blackberries that sweeten afternoon walks in warmer seasons. Located less than a mile to the Marquam Trails & Council Crest Park. Centrally located and close to Downtown, Hillsdale, and Beaverton conveniences. [Home Energy Score = 3.
