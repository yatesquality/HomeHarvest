PRICE! If gorgeous top of the mountain views of Flathead Lake and the Swan Mountains excites you, this home is a must see! Enter the property on the paved driveway to 5.6 acres of land and you will find a lovely three level home and large newly built shop for all your toys and equipment! The main part of the home is on the upper two floors and offers three bedrooms and two bathrooms. An open floor plan and large picture windows provides lots of natural light. Take in and enjoy lake views from the kitchen, dining area and living room and you will feel as if you are at a retreat. A pellet stove keeps the home warm and cozy on those cold winter days. Upstairs you will find a bright and spacious ensuite. Wake up to enjoy the sunrise each morning and walk out to a private deck! The bottom floor is a private apartment. With its own entrance this space would be the perfect guest quarters or a short- or long-term rental for extra income.

This lot is in the trees yet right off a county maintained paved road. With minor clearing you can have beautiful views of the private golf course and Whitefish Mountain Range. Build your Montana dream home and save money while doing it with Crystal Lakes community water and power at the road. This lot has both adjacent lots for sale (see MLS #'s 30044184, 30044176 & 30038402). So you have the potential to purchase over an acre and a half with the purchase of all 3 lots. Crystal Lakes is a very quiet community located 12 minutes south of Eureka and only 35 minutes to Whitefish, and mere minutes to thousands of acres of state and national forests, lakes, and rivers to explore.

miles west of Casper, Wyoming is the beautiful Pine Mountain Ranch. This unique 40+- acre property is 5.5 miles south of the state highway and another 1\/2 mile east of the maintained county. A seasonal draw cuts through it as it slopes downward to the south. It is offering seclusion and wide-open spaces bordering miles from the city lights, with great views of the big sky of Wyoming. It gives you views in all directions. This area has lots of wildlife including Elk, Mule Deer, Whitetails, Turkeys, Antelope, and Bear. Though for this property you will mostly share it with mule deer and antelope. Power is less than a 1\/2 mile away. If you are looking for a private escape or a place to relocate, this maybe what you have been looking for . Wyoming is a state with no income tax and the lowest populations density of any state in the union. Mild covenants and No HOA.

The property includes two lots totaling 16.54 acres, with the second lot undeveloped, offering the potential for resale if desired. Crafted using SIPS panel construction, the home exudes warmth with natural edge lumber on both the interior and exterior. The wood flooring, salvaged from a 1935 grain elevator, adds a historic touch, polished to perfection. The custom kitchen features an antique enamel sink, refurbished gas range, and a striking solid slab wood counter bar. Vaulted ceilings and Blue Pine accents enhance the home's open-concept living areas, creating a welcoming space that combines modern design with timeless character. The main floor master suite is a true retreat, featuring a large jetted tub, an infrared sauna, and a hot tub just outside, perfect for enjoying early mornings or quiet evenings. A spacious walk-in pantry and a laundry area, included with a guest half bath, complete the main floor. Upstairs, the lofted area includes an office, a non-conforming room, a full bath, and a large rec room, offering endless possibilities to add more bedrooms or create your ideal living space. This property is designed for both comfort and convenience. The attached 2-car garage, with 13-foot ceilings and ample storage, and the 30' x 40' detached shop, heated and insulated, provide plenty of space for hobbies, work, and storage. The shop is even plumbed for a bathroom. Additionally, the property is set up for off-grid power if needed, wired to run on a generator. Outside, the land provides abundant recreational opportunities with access to BLM land for hiking, hunting, and exploring. Wildlife, including deer, turkey, and mountain sheep, frequent the property. The owners have also created fenced areas for a garden, chicken coop, and additional storage. Two storage sheds with log siding and a metal roof add to the property's charm. Conveniently located, the property is just 60 miles from Malta, where you'll find groceries, schools, and other amenities. Zortman, a nearby town, is 20 minutes away, and the Missouri River Breaks and James Kipp Recreation Area are just a short drive. Billings, with the closest commercial airport, is about 160 miles away. Property taxes for 2024 were $2, 468, and the home is serviced by a private well and septic system, with the well providing 25 gallons per minute at a depth of 130 feet. This mountain retreat offers a unique opportunity to experience peace, privacy, and outdoor adventure. Don't miss your chance to make this exceptional property your new home.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"454 Square Butte Ln","street":"454 Square Butte

However, these qualities all come together nicely with this wonderfully bright 2-bedroom, 1 bathroom condominium. Located in the well-managed and respected 4100 Mullan Condominiums, this spacious and tidy unit offers 880 square feet of comfortable, low-maintenance living. Elevator access is provided to this condominium's position on the third floor - a location that makes this unit feel very private and secluded. The top floor positioning also offers sky-high views from the condo's back deck, which looks directly across to the mountains and trailheads surrounding Missoula. Perhaps even more appealing is that the interior of this condominium offers a very airy and open layout. Because the two bedrooms in this unit are open to the living area they are technically non-conforming, however, this specific layout offers a lot of flexibility and really creates a very spacious and loft-style feel to this condominium. There is no doubt that the focal point of this condominium is the unit's wonderfully cozy and centrally situated gas fireplace. Adjacent to the living room is the kitchen, which is compact but extremely functional. It boasts beautiful granite countertops, an eat-in bar space, as well as an over-sized pantry. To be honest, it is quite hard to overstate how move-in ready this condominium is! The unit has received new interior paint throughout, brand-new carpet was installed in April of 2025, a new heating and cooling wall unit was recently installed, a newer garbage disposal has also been installed, and the unit was professionally cleaned as well. If the updated interior condition wasn't appealing enough, this condominium also includes an assigned, covered carport space and access to the 4100 Clubhouse. The 4100 Clubhouse offers a complete fitness center, game room, pool table, and a stylish gathering and lounge space. HOA dues for these condos are just $250\/month which ensures that this is truly a hassle free investment. The dues pay for water, sewer, trash, recycling, exterior maintenance, common area maintenance, and snow removal. Conveniently located near Target, Costco, and several other major shopping destinations, this condominium is really quite ideal as a personal residence or as a very smart rental opportunity. This development is pet-friendly and long-term rentals are allowed. Dont miss your chance to own one of Missoulas most affordable and well-appointed condominiums. It is hard to imagine that this property will be on the market for long.","style":"CONDOS","full_street_line":"4100 Mullan Rd Unit 117","street":"4100 Mullan Rd","unit":"Unit 117","city":"Missoula","state":"MT","zip_code":"59808","beds":2,"full_baths":1,"half_baths":null,"sqft":880,"year_built":2008,"days_on_mls":34,"list_price":299900,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-04-11","sold_price":null,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-15","assessed_value":268500,"estimated_value":305600,"tax":3233,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":3233,"assessment":{"building":268402,"land":98,"total":268500}},{"year":2023,"tax":2994,"assessment":{"building":268402,"land":98,"total":268500}},{"year":2022,"tax":1936,"assessment":{"building":138516,"land":6884,"total":145400}},{"year":2021,"tax":1828,"assessment":{"building":138516,"land":6884,"total":145400}},{"year":2020,"tax":1807,"assessment":{"building":139552,"land":48,"total":139600}},{"year":2019,"tax":1786,"assessment":{"building":139552,"land":48,"total":139600}},{"year":2018,"tax":1808,"assessment":{"building":137490,"land":10,"total":137500}},{"year":2017,"tax":1780,"assessment":{"building":137490,"land":10,"total":137500}},{"year":2016,"tax":1569,"assessment":{"building":125725,"land":2975,"total":128700}},{"year":2015,"tax":1480,"assessment":{"building":125725,"land":2975,"total":128700}},{"year":2014,"tax":1486,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":71086}},{"year":2013,"tax":1440,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":70310}},{"year":2012,"tax":1435,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":69386}},{"year":2011,"tax":1475,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":69141}},{"year":2010,"tax":1588,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":72027}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":null,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":46.886672,"longitude":-114.049263,"neighborhoods":"Captain John Mullan","county":"Missoula","fips_code":"30063","stories":1,"hoa_fee":250,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"2049815","agent_name":"Aaron Curtis","agent_email":"aaron.curtis@bhhsmt.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"4063962721"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"4067214141"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-KAMT-MT.545050246","agent_nrds_id":"545050246","broker_id":"968881","broker_name":"BHHS Montana Properties","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"2244702","office_mls_set":"O-KAMT-545000003","office_name":"Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Montana Properties -

The home is designed to capture unobstructed views: the Mission Mountains to the east, Bison Range to the west, and rolling grass fields to the north and south. The nearest neighbor is a quarter mile away. Built for 4 seasons, the home is masterfully constructed from R34 SIP wall panels and R50 SIP roof panels. Practical polished-concrete floors deliver radiant floor heat. Wide wraparound patios provide choices for relaxing outside, regardless of breezes or angle of the sun. No stairs from the garage through the main living area to the patios and gardens. A delightful guesthouse makes it possible for guests and owners to have private space, with a deck facing the mountains and connects with the spacious three-car garage and storage spaces. Please see 3D Interactive Virtual Tour. Call Carol Tibbles or your real estate professional. Please see documents for additional information regarding construction from SIP panels.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"60566 Hillside Rd","street":"60566 Hillside

The primary bedroom has an attached three-quarter bathroom, while the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms and largest bathroom are on the opposing side of the home. Nice breakfast bar peeks through the windows to the mature trees in the backyard where birds love to gather. Spacious 2 car garage is insulated. Underground sprinklers control your water usage, and there is a nice privacy fence in the backyard. There is a lot to love in this well maintained home! The water heater and furnace were both replaced in '23 and '24 respectively.

This one-of-a-kind estate features a 7693sf home, designed and built by Talus Architects and Lohss Construction, two of Montanas premier design-build teams, positioned on the property to capture views of the Absaroka Mountains and the river from all angles. With the opportunity to complete this project in your own vision - from interior finishes to landscaping - theres an incredible amount of equity to be added to what is perhaps the finest luxury offering ever to come to market in Paradise Valley. What sets 54 Rocky Hollow Trail apart is the direct, private river frontage on a portion of the Yellowstone River that is described by many as the finest fishable water in the world - a true fishermans paradise. With end-of-the-road privacy via a gated driveway, the home cant be seen from the road and yet is only fifteen minutes to burgeoning downtown Livingston and a mere walk to the increasingly hip village of Pine Creek, where famous musicians play year round. Inside the home, youre greeted by vaulted ceilings in every room and huge windows that take in snow capped peaks and riparian views at every turn. The open-concept living space and entertainers kitchen lead to five private guest suites in one direction and a gigantic master suite in the other. Built with the finest attention to detail and finishes, from the slate roof to the soaring engineering feat of the entry portico, the home feels like it belongs in the Yellowstone Club - and yet the property has no CC&Rs or building restrictions. With plans to build a fishable pond and guest house in place theres nothing stopping the expansion of this already magnificent estate - and plenty of room to do so. If what youve been searching for is peace, quiet, ethereal views and your own slice of fly fishing heaven then look no further - 54 Rocky Hollow Trail is unlike anything youve ever experienced - and can ever experience again.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"54 Rocky Hollow Trl","street":"54 Rocky Hollow

Numerous updates to this 1 level, open concept home have been completed in recent years beginning with a new roof in 2013 followed by new siding and gutters in 2015. Both bathrooms were entirely remodeled in 2022-2023 while the kitchen was also undergoing a facelift. Flooring and interior paint have been updated throughout and a grey composite deck, the entire width of the home was added off the back door offering fantastic views of the sunrise and a shaded place to sit on summer afternoons. The most notable improvement however is the addition of the detached 32' x 40' heated garage, completed in 2024. Concrete floor, automatic door, insulation, sheetrock and natural gas heater are complete and ready for use. The second story was finished for use as a private office\/sleeping area, with wide plank whitewashed wood floor and ample natural light. Extensive gardening has been done on the property, with 3 large established beds and plenty of perennials for new owners to enjoy for years to come. A greenhouse on the property can be included if the new owner wishes to maintain the practice. Additional outbuildings include 2 open-faced pole barns (20'x50' and 20'x18') and an additional 22 'x 24' heated garage built in 1949, perfect for use as storage, a warm area for animals and\/or a tack room. Perimeter fencing has been well maintained and decorative post and rail fence was added near the house in 2015. A stock water tank near the outbuildings as well as a frost-free hydrant provide water for livestock and gardening. City water is in place and the private septic tank was last pumped in 2022. This incredibly convenient location is on a school bus route just minutes from town, with access provided by a well-maintained gravel road. The home has been well taken care of and continually updated by current and previous owners, and the small acreage provides space for animals, outbuilding buildings, parking, or just a bit of elbow room.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"208 Green Acres Dr","street":"208 Green Acres

Described by the Seller as a home she has always loved, her care for the property is evident throughout. Most recently, thanks to the tenacity of the local flicker population, the home's stucco exterior was entirely replaced with a cement composite that has successfully sent the flickers packing. The beautiful back decks that offer private outdoor living were also reinforced at the time of the exterior work. The owner has lived lightly which is emphasized by the cleanliness and condition of the home - no pets or muddy boots here! The spacious main level features an inviting living area with access to the upper deck and beautiful Missoula views. The space is open to the dining area and kitchen, both with additional windows to capture the city views and mountains beyond. Also on the main level, the front room is perfect for a bedroom, office or cozy den and is adjacent to a full bathroom. Access to the over-size double garage is on this level as well. Downstairs, the daylight, lower level includes a spacious primary suite with an en suite bathroom, as well as another bedroom with a private balcony and an additional bathroom (be sure to admire the plaid wallpaper - it can't have been easy to hang it so perfectly!) The laundry room and mechanical room are located on this level as well. Don't miss this wonderful opportunity to have all the space you need right in the heart of Missoula.

This Luxurious Cabin is nestled into a scenic rock cliff overlooking Wild Horse Island & one of the most spectacular views of Flathead Lake. The craftmanship of this home\/cabin is very unique as is its location. There is a space where the previous owners said, an rv or additional home could be placed, (not verified by current sellers). There is plenty to see from the lake end, however a hike up to the top of this property is another experience you wont soon forget, more scenic views & wildlife. The 250'+ of shore line offers plenty to explore and provides a unique location for a boat dock.

than brand new! This lightly lived-in Townhouse, unlike any other, has been upgraded with intention. From the Cafe Series kitchen appliances, the GE Power Steam front-loader washer and dryer set, and the four-person saltwater hot tub, this home is turnkey and appointed to impress. The second-story balcony is perfectly positioned over the carport, providing additional parking for the attached single-car garage. The Bridger views are not to be missed! This is a more considerable lot for this community, offering generous space to relax and entertain. Thanks to the natural gas amenity, this property also features central A\/C. Unlike brand-new construction, 409 Meriwether has handled the after-closing expenses for you! Cordless honeycomb blinds have been installed throughout. The fencing is complete, with an additional outdoor Trex deck in place to facilitate your lounging outdoors (since the saltwater hot tub utilizes a notable portion of the covered patio space), and a camera doorbell and a smart thermostat have been installed to keep you connected to your property when you are home or away! With an office or bedroom on the main level and three additional bedrooms upstairs, this property provides room to grow or a phenomenal investment opportunity. Work from home or capitalize on extra income opportunities, be that additional rent or working from home. The three full bathrooms are a nice bonus, allowing guests to be removed entirely from accessing the upstairs suites, if so desired. Don't miss the fantastic community park, just one door south of this perfectly positioned townhouse.","style":"TOWNHOMES","full_street_line":"409 Meriwether Ave","street":"409 Meriwether

to the Jailhouse Condos located in the heart of Uptown Butte, Montana where historic charm meets modern living. These brand-new condos are housed within the storied walls of a century old building that was Buttes original City Hall. The upper floor has been transformed into two luxury residential condos. Whether you are an owner-occupant looking for a care-free lifestyle for either a primary or secondary residence, or an investor, these condos are a must-see. This redevelopment project is another example that showcases Buttes proud historical heritage while embracing modern advancements and creating a vibrant and diverse urban environment with a rural Montana Community.","style":"CONDOS","full_street_line":"114 W Park St Unit B","street":"114 W Park St","unit":"Unit B","city":"Butte","state":"MT","zip_code":"59701","beds":1,"full_baths":1,"half_baths":null,"sqft":900,"year_built":1900,"days_on_mls":70,"list_price":299000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-02-26","sold_price":null,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-07","assessed_value":null,"estimated_value":null,"tax":null,"tax_history":null,"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":null,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Silver Bow","fips_code":null,"stories":1,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"67919","agent_name":"Gary Shea","agent_email":"gary@c21shea.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"4067235455"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"4064907432"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-GAMT-3071568","agent_nrds_id":"85000281","broker_id":"3656914","broker_name":"CENTURY 21 SHEA REALTY","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"150743","office_mls_set":"O-GAMT-3071560","office_name":"CENTURY 21 Shea Realty","office_email":"office@shearealtors.com","office_phones":[{"number":"4067235455","type":"Office","primary":true,"ext":null},{"number":"(406) 782-8600","type":"Fax","primary":false,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":null,"primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m3631210236od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m3631210236od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m37293829od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m456993775od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m3947478891od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m3158032084od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m4272075521od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m3397869360od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m494412344od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m318977373od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m1596876251od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m4056337650od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m2256499950od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m1497115469od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m2852695515od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/dbd199b6e28b400374d0ef020c92b65al-m421038185od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/645-Woodland-Pl-Apt-8_Whitefish_MT_59937_M81366-36808","property_id":"8136636808","listing_id":"2978335590","mls":"KAMT","mls_id":"30039008","status":"SOLD","text":"Take in the breathtaking views of Whitefish Mountain Resort from this inviting 3-bedroom, 2-bath Falcon Place Condo, where Montanas thrill of outdoor adventure seamlessly blends with luxurious comfort.

The open dining and living rooms feel bright and warm with new large windows, original stained glass and a new contemporary gas fireplace. Additional updates include the bathroom, laundry room, and new plumbing, electrical, drywall and windows throughout.
