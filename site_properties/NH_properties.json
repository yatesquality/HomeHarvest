HOUSE Saturday March 15th 1-3 PM! Looking for a home that's anything but cookie-cutter? This expanded Cape Cod gives you the best of both worlds-classic vibes with lots of space! With 5 bedrooms, 1 full bath, and 2 half baths, there's plenty of room to make it your own. On the first floor, you'll find two bedrooms, one full bath and one half bath, plus a layout that provides lots of versatility-a cozy living room, formal dining room, and a den for work from home or hobbies. But the real star? A huge family room with lots of windows and a woodstove-perfect for movie nights, game days and large gatherings. Upstairs, this home has two separate second floors, each with its own space. In total, you get three more bedrooms and an extra half bath, meaning you can finally have that guest room, home studio, or whatever else you've been dreaming of. The original basement has laundry and storage, while the second basement comes with an integral two-car garage-so no more fighting over parking or where to put your gear. This place has so much potential to make it completely yours. If you're looking for space, character, and a layout that's far from basic, this is it!","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"1558 Scotland Ave","street":"1558 Scotland Ave","unit":null,"city":"Chambersburg","state":"PA","zip_code":"17201","beds":5,"full_baths":1,"half_baths":2,"sqft":2447,"year_built":1948,"days_on_mls":84,"list_price":280000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-02-18","sold_price":275000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-13","assessed_value":19350,"estimated_value":272800,"tax":3838,"tax_history":[{"year":2025,"tax":3838,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2024,"tax":3682,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2023,"tax":3587,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2022,"tax":3489,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2021,"tax":3470,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2020,"tax":3394,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2019,"tax":3295,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2018,"tax":3194,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2017,"tax":3009,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2016,"tax":2952,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2015,"tax":2831,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2014,"tax":2784,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2013,"tax":903,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2012,"tax":889,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2011,"tax":889,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2010,"tax":889,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2009,"tax":879,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}},{"year":2008,"tax":811,"assessment":{"building":18100,"land":1250,"total":19350}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":7405,"price_per_sqft":112,"latitude":39.950608,"longitude":-77.640932,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Franklin","fips_code":"42055","stories":2,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":2,"agent_id":"1542534","agent_name":"Lisa Mack","agent_email":"lisa.mack@cbhomes.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"7172647999"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"7176093781"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-PHPA-3028169","agent_nrds_id":"725008297","broker_id":"1991642","broker_name":"NRT-Central Penn","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"38054","office_mls_set":"O-PHPA-JGR4","office_name":"Coldwell Banker Realty","office_email":null,"office_phones":[{"number":"7172647999","type":"Office","primary":true,"ext":null},{"number":"7172670015","type":"Fax","primary":false,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"Chambersburg Area School District, Franklin County Career And Technical Center","primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/46aef2532959d7265c358c89759fee30l-b662932338od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/46aef2532959d7265c358c89759fee30l-b662932338od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/512-Siloam-Rd_Chambersburg_PA_17201_M32722-89009","property_id":"3272289009","listing_id":"2977730315","mls":"PHPA","mls_id":"PAFL2024954","status":"SOLD","text":"COZY, AFFORDABLE RANCH...3 bedrooms, 1 bath.
