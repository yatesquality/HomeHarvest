The main level features a living room, dining room, kitchen, primary bedroom, secondary bedroom and a full bathroom. The upper level is partially finished. It was closed off from the lower level many years ago. It could function as an upstairs apartment or possibly opened back up to the lower level. A large portion of it is unfinished. The previous owner used it as a workshop. Framing is already in place to finish into bedrooms, a bathroom, and more. The house is located on a beautiful large level 2 acre lot. Must use extreme caution when entering the property! No repairs will be made. The floor system has dropped in different areas on the main level.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"2068 Rader Cir","street":"2068 Rader Cir","unit":null,"city":"Morganton","state":"NC","zip_code":"28655","beds":4,"full_baths":1,"half_baths":null,"sqft":1190,"year_built":1901,"days_on_mls":185,"list_price":199000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2024-11-11","sold_price":150000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-15","assessed_value":143352,"estimated_value":201525,"tax":1084,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":1084,"assessment":{"building":118665,"land":24687,"total":143352}},{"year":2023,"tax":1084,"assessment":{"building":118665,"land":24687,"total":143352}},{"year":2022,"tax":1030,"assessment":{"building":98055,"land":16292,"total":114347}},{"year":2021,"tax":1024,"assessment":{"building":98055,"land":16292,"total":114347}},{"year":2020,"tax":974,"assessment":{"building":98055,"land":16292,"total":114347}},{"year":2019,"tax":974,"assessment":{"building":98055,"land":16292,"total":114347}},{"year":2018,"tax":944,"assessment":{"building":94235,"land":16292,"total":110527}},{"year":2017,"tax":943,"assessment":{"building":94235,"land":16292,"total":110527}},{"year":2016,"tax":910,"assessment":{"building":94235,"land":16292,"total":110527}},{"year":2015,"tax":908,"assessment":{"building":94235,"land":16292,"total":110527}},{"year":2014,"tax":906,"assessment":{"building":94235,"land":16292,"total":110527}},{"year":2013,"tax":906,"assessment":{"building":94235,"land":16292,"total":110527}},{"year":2012,"tax":800,"assessment":{"building":101154,"land":21352,"total":122506}},{"year":2011,"tax":807,"assessment":{"building":101154,"land":21352,"total":122506}},{"year":2010,"tax":792,"assessment":{"building":101154,"land":21352,"total":122506}},{"year":2009,"tax":789,"assessment":{"building":101154,"land":21352,"total":122506}},{"year":2008,"tax":789,"assessment":{"building":101154,"land":21352,"total":122506}},{"year":2007,"tax":784,"assessment":{"building":101154,"land":21352,"total":122506}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":87120,"price_per_sqft":126,"latitude":35.810764,"longitude":-81.658909,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Burke","fips_code":"37023","stories":2,"hoa_fee":null,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"620984","agent_name":"Marianna Geyer","agent_email":"marianna.geyer@exprealty.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"8282340490"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-CHNC-CV69695","agent_nrds_id":"552000825","broker_id":null,"broker_name":"Exp Realty Llc -
