of the most unique and rare opportunities in all of Oklahoma! This huge French country luxury estate sits behind a private gated driveway on 80 beautiful acres with fields of natural flowers, groves of trees, a fruit orchard, and two ponds. The rarity of this property comes from being zoned RE, with an option of being developed into a beautiful neighborhood, or keeping it as is for its natural beauty. Upon entering the custom eight foot Rob Key Design iron doors, you find yourself in the living room with beautiful natural lighting from the huge wall of windows overlooking the orchard and fields. The wide plank hardwood floors lead you into the expansive chefs kitchen with plenty of cabinets for storage, two ovens, a large island, a custom seven-foot Galley Sink, and a large walk-in pantry. The Primary Suite is located on the first floor with three tiered ceilings and a huge walk-in closet with washer\/dryer hookups. The luxurious primary bath offers a true spa experience and includes copper sinks, a copper clawfoot tub, and a huge shower lined with river rock. The first floor also includes two additional bedrooms and another optional bedroom\/office. A second living area overlooks the downstairs, leading to a private guest suite with spectacular views of the pond. Also, upstairs you will find a huge bonus\/game room. Multiple outdoor living areas surround a beautiful gunite pool and hot tub, and the pool house can serve as an additional living space. The gardens are bountiful and lined with large river rocks harvested from the property with flowerbeds that bloom in waves during spring, summer, and fall and groves of trees planted around the home. The home also includes a Generac generator. The entire property is bordered by pines and evergreens for increased privacy and windbreak. Easy access to highway 75, only 15 minutes away from Downtown Tulsa and the airport. POF required before showing. Seller is licensed real estate agent.

Remodeled - Reimagined Floor Plan! This stunning home has undergone a complete transformation, with significant changes to its original footprint to enhance both functionality and modern appeal. A built-in desk with an outdated phone jack was removed, reframed, and converted into a custom pantry with shelving and a stylish sliding barn door. The former, formal dining room has been reconfigured into an enclosed flex space, perfect for an office, playroom, content creation area, or additional sitting space. A large window fills the room with abundant natural light, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Major upgrades include all-new flooring throughout, new kitchen cabinet doors, fresh interior and exterior paint, new trim, and new toilets.

OPPORTUNITY for an investor or other buyer willing to do a renovation loan! This property is a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom home undergoing renovations. Most of the hard work has already been done for you, including a new HVAC unit and a new roof (installed Feb.2025) The best part is that you have the opportunity to pick out remaining design choices to your taste! There are 3 guest rooms upstairs that have all been remodeled, aside from a fresh coat of paint needed in one of the rooms. This is one of my favorite rooms, as it has doors opening to a balcony that overlooks the in-ground pool. Demolition has been completed in the upstairs bathroom and it's just waiting for you to put it back together. One bedroom has new carpet, but you can decide on the rest of the upstairs flooring choice. The living room and primary ensuite downstairs has been completed with some new drywall, new doors, new paint, new ceiling fan, custom closet, walk-in tiled shower and more! In the kitchen you'll find more cabinets have been added, as well as a new bar with seating to be finished. The kitchen is equipped with black stainless steele appliances that will remain with the home. Speaking of the kitchen, I think you'll fall in love with the view of the pool from the large kitchen windows. Imagine sunning in the cool of the water or just relaxing under the shade of the covered patio! Whatever your preference, the corner yard provides a space for all of your entertainment needs. Schedule your private viewing and come see this amazing potential for yourself.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"2508 S Fir Ave","street":"2508 S Fir Ave","unit":null,"city":"Broken

Right next to Curtis Inge Middle School. 3 Bed 2 Full bath. Very large closet in the primary bedroom. This home has a good sized laundry room right off of the two car garage and has an ample storage closet adjacent to it. Access to the large back yard from the dining area as well as from the primary bedroom. Nice covered patio in the back yard featuring a swinging bench and fire pit. New stockade fence with metal posts was installed in 2023 featuring a double gate on the east side of the home. Great investment opportunity. It could use a little TLC, but could be a really nice brick home for the new homeowner. Windows and roof are being repaired by the seller.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"521 Woodbriar Rd","street":"521 Woodbriar
