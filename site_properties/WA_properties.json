your house plans to this easy to build level lot! This nice piece of prairie is just over 6 acres. This lot will NOT require a critical area review because all of that has been done already! Small swale toward the back of the property is the designated wetland, but plenty of room to build your house, shop, etc on this lot. Easy prairie soils for a standard pressurized septic system. Wells in the area are around 80' deep. The lot has its own designated access from Gibson Rd, see survey map. Do not enter property without a real estate broker.","style":"LAND","full_street_line":"16208 Gibson Rd SW","street":"16208 Gibson Rd","unit":null,"city":"Tenino","state":"WA","zip_code":"98589","beds":null,"full_baths":null,"half_baths":null,"sqft":null,"year_built":null,"days_on_mls":65,"list_price":175000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-03-12","sold_price":169000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-16","assessed_value":null,"estimated_value":null,"tax":null,"tax_history":null,"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":267023,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":46.853119,"longitude":-122.958542,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Thurston","fips_code":"53067","stories":null,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"995707","agent_name":"Jessica Grubb","agent_email":"jessicagrubb@remax.net","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"3607018195"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"3607018195"},{"ext":null,"primary":false,"type":"Fax","number":"3603578274"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-SEWA-80500","agent_nrds_id":"869053318","broker_id":"4481520","broker_name":"RE\/MAX Advantage WA - Broker","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"4481525","office_mls_set":"O-SEWA-6820","office_name":"RE MAX Advantage - The Four Seasons Group","office_email":"kim@advantagermx.com","office_phones":[{"number":"5098888262","type":"BUSINESS_PHONE","primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"Tenino School District","primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/c98c1e2e9f1e6e8048ffe408cac35724l-m3728914306od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/c98c1e2e9f1e6e8048ffe408cac35724l-m3728914306od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/c98c1e2e9f1e6e8048ffe408cac35724l-m2284970771od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/c98c1e2e9f1e6e8048ffe408cac35724l-m633385758od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/1010-N-Littlejohn-Way_Sequim_WA_98382_M29428-62239","property_id":"2942862239","listing_id":"2979421908","mls":"OPWA","mls_id":"390291","status":"SOLD","text":"Fabulous, mountain view condo in Sherwood Village with amazing sun windows on 3 sides. $100, 000 updates in last 5 years with all new flooring, quartz counters, backsplash, ductless heat pump & mini split, appliances, extra pantry, faucets, toilets, walk-in shower, & water heater, ramp in garage & doggie door!
