downtown duplex within walking distance of Westchester Lagoon, New Sagaya, & The Park Strip. The upper owner's unit has undergone a re-design by architect Mike Mense to expand the entry way and add a primary bedroom loft suite with mountain views. The rest of the house has a modern bungalow vibe made up of two bedrooms, home office, and a well-designed kitchen and living space that's hosted many parties over the years. Its charm comes from the small details like the circular built-in entry way bench, the colorful kitchen tile backsplash, and the glass block accents that enhance the natural light. The two-bed\/one-bath apartment below has been completely updated with new cabinets, countertop, paint, and flooring. It's had steady tenants for over twenty years and has two off-street parking spaces and a concrete walkway with separate entrance. The entire property is landscaped with trees, shrubs, and perennials. The outdoor deck provides southern exposure perfect for summer for barbecues and relaxing with a glass of wine after a long day. Many other updates completed over the years including new windows, a roof replacement, and new exterior paint in 2011.","style":"MULTI_FAMILY","full_street_line":"1310 P St","street":"1310 P

With two buildings, electricity, a well and a septic system already in place - this property is a turn-key escape just waiting for you. Natural gas is nearby for an easy hookup. Each building is separately metered, making it ideal for a rental property.

remodeled home, convenient to shopping and the best commute location in the valley! This home is a must see! With 5 bedrooms, including a massive primary suite, 2 family room areas, 3 full bathrooms, ample storage, and a large eat in kitchen, this home has plenty of space for everyone. It would also be well suited for for multi-generational living. Inside you will find new paint and flooring throughout, a beautiful hickory kitchen complete with granite counter tops, and stainless steel appliances, including a new dishwasher. The gorgeous new 22, 000 BTU stone fireplace, is the perfect place to warm up during these Alaskan winters. The upstairs living room also features a large triple pane picture window that brings in abundant natural light and looks toward the northern skies for optimal Northern Lights viewing. The primary suite is spacious, and completely private, as it is away from the other bedrooms, and situated above the garage. The closet is oversized, and offers plenty of shelving for all of your storage needs. The primary bathroom features a double vanity, as well as double shower heads, and a large open area that would be perfect for an in-home sauna. The remaining bedrooms are split with 2 upstairs, and 2 downstairs along with a full bath on each level that has been completely redone. All 4 bedrooms have large closets, including walk in closets in two of the rooms. In the lower level, you will find the second family room, as well as the oversized laundry room that has a utility sink, and a brand new tankless water heater. There is also a huge indoor storage room that houses the brand new gas furnace and could easily accommodate a chest freezer, or two, and storage for all your Costco sized items. This home has been thoughtfully updated, with efficiency in mind. The newer metal roof should last for many years to come, and the triple pane windows throughout help to hold more heat inside of the home. The basement foundation walls were also polysealed, with an R value of 24. The garage unit heater was also recently added. The outside of the home has been completely repainted, including the deck and shed, new gutters, and a new front porch was added. New pavers were added to the walkway, and a new retaining wall was built next to the driveway. This home offers plenty of additional parking, potential RV parking and\/or covered boat parking thanks to the 520 sq ft carport. The yard is level, has sweeping mountain views, a dog run and offers southern exposure, to soak up those nice long Alaskan summer nights.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"4894 E Rhubarb

980 sq ft shop with 10' ceilings; WIFI compatible breaker panel wired for 220v welding outlets or EV charging; Calacatta quartz countertops; Built in safe, etc.This smartly designed shop\/house is a beautiful addition to the well-established and relaxed Forest Lakes subdivision. Set well enough back from the road with new topping on the driveway, you will enjoy a great deal of privacy that few others have. (This could be an excellent base for all your Alaskan adventures). The first floor features a 980 square foot shop with 10' ceilings. This creator space is large enough for full size trucks, storage, a work bench and space to work on those projects in comfort. The breaker panel is WIFI compatible and is wired for EV charging or a 220v welding outlet. A half bath with laundry hookups is located adjacent to the garage. The mechanical room is well stocked with the very best equipment available for ease of use with energy efficient in-floor heating. Upstairs you have the kitchen which is the heart of the home. Hardwood cabinets with soft close hardware and topped with Calacatta quartz countertops make this space a dream to entertain in. To one side you have a full bath and bedroom for children or guests. On the other you have the dining area, office\/pantry and living room. The living room area is bathed in light and beautiful views thanks to the floor to ceiling window wall. The entertainment nook is wired for high-speed data and features matching built-in storage with a butcher block top. As you move into the master bedroom you may admire the fancy lighting or the view from your private balcony; or if you're like me your attention will immediately travel to the built-in wall safe. That's right, a built in, high security vault in your very own bedroom. The privacy and space continue into the master bathroom with double vanities, linen storage, a generous walk-in closet and a dedicated makeup counter. The shower is luxe with polished tile and double shower heads that are individually controlled for temperature and pressure for the ultimate experience. This home is currently 99% complete and construction will be done in the next few weeks.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"10325 W Lakeshore Dr","street":"10325 W Lakeshore

The only shared wall in the entire building is between the oversized double car garages (park 2 trucks plus plenty of room for ATVs\/toys in each!), so these units live very much like single family homes. Tenants typically stay for years. Nice, established neighborhood, in a cozy pocket culdesac near Spruce and Lucus. Continuously updated and meticulously maintained, mirrored layout side by side 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom, 2+ car garage units. Each kitchen has a large breakfast bar, and living spaces are open concept with a comfortable and convenient flow to spacious living and dining areas.

Energy efficient Crane siding with 60 year warranty. Each unit has stainless appliances, spacious 30' X 24' (720sq.ft. each) double car garages, huge paved parking area approximately 60' X 50', a great floorplan that tenants love for privacy and quiet, especially with the garages blocking any sound transfer between units.

A triple water filtration system and seamless aluminum gutters have been added, nice, flat, established yard has some perennials, 6' wood fence provides separation and privacy between the back yards, and trees provide barrier between other properties. Low-density neighborhood, quiet culdesac with just 4 duplexes, each on large, valley acre lots, convenient to town but feels very private. One year basic HSA Home Warranty to be provided by the seller! Photos of units are indicative of current condition - Unit A interior photos are from October 2023, Unit B interior photos were taken November 2024. Both units are occupied and on month to month agreements with excellent tenants so rates have been kept below market, Unit A is at $2250 + utilities \/ B current rent rate is $2050 +
