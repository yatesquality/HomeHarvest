The spacious full basement includes a separate room, perfect for extra storage or a home office. Per Seller: Recent updates ensure peace of mind with a new water heater (2024), AC system (2024), and new bathroom vent. The windows were replaced around 5 years ago, and major appliances like the dishwasher (2 years old), fridge, and stove (both less than a year old) offer modern efficiency.

great proximity to Indiana University and College Mall conveniences in this wonderfully updated home on Bloomingtons east side in Shadow Creek.

An impressive list of design upgrades and updates are combined with a long list of practical money-saving improvements make this a very logical, yet beautiful choice. first, lets begin with the kitchen. The gorgeous contrasting island accents the fashionable backsplash and white cabinetry for great style and entertaining and the updated appliances add to the cooking and cleaning ease. The circular plan with two-story great room, accesses the dining room, then kitchen and extended family room with fireplace. Additional entertaining space flows out to the 2018 Trex composite deck with an arbor for comfortable entertaining and views of the park-like backyard. In 2012 and 2019 the owners installed two rounds of solar panels that are crucial to the energy savings of this home. The panels are grandfathered into the net metering agreement with Duke Energy and they agree to buy the solar production for the same price that they charge for electricity. This agreement is in perpetuity and transferable to the new owners. (Since July 2019, the owners monthly Duke Energy bills have been $11.28 which are the fees and taxes due. The sellers replaced the roof in 2019.) The upper level of this fashionable home has an enormous primary suite with a walk-in dressing room, study area, or reading area, and a magnificently updated spa bath with soaking tub, tasteful, ceramic walk-in shower, and beautiful new vanity with stone accent. There are a total of four nicely scaled upper-level bedrooms, and the lower level has an additional bedroom area that could also be used as a study or recreation space. The lower level has a family room, and full bath, and walks out to a beautifully landscaped patio area.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"1560 S Andrew Cir","street":"1560 S Andrew Cir","unit":null,"city":"Bloomington","state":"IN","zip_code":"47401","beds":5,"full_baths":3,"half_baths":1,"sqft":3604,"year_built":2006,"days_on_mls":252,"list_price":659000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2024-09-05","sold_price":640000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-15","assessed_value":477600,"estimated_value":646000,"tax":5303,"tax_history":[{"year":2023,"tax":5303,"assessment":{"building":362600,"land":115000,"total":477600}},{"year":2022,"tax":4935,"assessment":{"building":330400,"land":115000,"total":445400}},{"year":2021,"tax":4302,"assessment":{"building":298800,"land":110000,"total":408800}},{"year":2020,"tax":4030,"assessment":{"building":272000,"land":110000,"total":382000}},{"year":2019,"tax":3833,"assessment":{"building":277200,"land":85000,"total":362200}},{"year":2018,"tax":3572,"assessment":{"building":261900,"land":75000,"total":336900}},{"year":2017,"tax":3574,"assessment":{"building":261200,"land":75000,"total":336200}},{"year":2016,"tax":3232,"assessment":{"building":236400,"land":64000,"total":300400}},{"year":2015,"tax":3195,"assessment":{"building":221200,"land":60000,"total":281200}},{"year":2013,"tax":3510,"assessment":{"building":255200,"land":50000,"total":305200}},{"year":2012,"tax":3411,"assessment":{"building":239900,"land":65000,"total":304900}},{"year":2011,"tax":3338,"assessment":{"building":249500,"land":65000,"total":314500}},{"year":2010,"tax":2991,"assessment":{"building":249500,"land":70000,"total":319500}},{"year":2008,"tax":6008,"assessment":{"building":255200,"land":79500,"total":334700}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":17860,"price_per_sqft":178,"latitude":39.148096,"longitude":-86.492953,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Monroe","fips_code":"18105","stories":2,"hoa_fee":null,"parking_garage":2,"agent_id":"45934","agent_name":"Jeff Franklin","agent_email":"franklin@homefinder.org","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"8123605333"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"8123307515"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-FWIN-BL383025953","agent_nrds_id":"383025953","broker_id":"1613517","broker_name":"F.C.
