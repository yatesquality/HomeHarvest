home is a show stopper! It has been lovingly maintained and truly looks and feels like a brand new home. There are 3 spacious levels with custom blinds, updated lighting and ceiling fans throughout. Hardwood floors everywhere except upstairs bedrooms, and much more. The owners used this home as a second home for the first three years. All appliances and equipment are like new. High ceilings and lots of natural light throughout the home. The HOA has replaced all porches on the exterior units with Polywood for easy maintenance. The roof has also been replaced. Excellent location- just minutes from Sullivan's or IOP, easy access to 526 and the airport, and close to Trader Joe's and shopping. The lower level can be used as a bedroom, office, gym, hang outspace or whichever suits your needs. There is a full bathroom and access to the outside patio. There is also a 3 stop elevator rough in. Currently, it's being used as storage. This home is one of a kind. Upgraded landscape package due to be installed in the upcoming weeks HOA covers all exterior maintenance, landscaping, power washing, painting, roofing, and termite bond.","style":"TOWNHOMES","full_street_line":"1052 Bowman Woods Dr","street":"1052 Bowman Woods Dr","unit":null,"city":"Mount

custom-built 4-bedroom, 3.5-bath modern home on Molasses Creek in Hobcaw Point. Home was expertly and artfully designed by MIT and Clemson-trained architect, Ken Huggins, to emphasize indoor\/outdoor living that blends discreetly into the landscape. As you approach the front entrance, note the subtle privacy screen that helps define a small courtyard and covered stoop. Enter the foyer where a large window opposite the glass front door reveals spherical fountains in an oak wrapped vestibule bound by the continuation of the privacy screen along the front of the house. The foyer's wood-covered ceiling and back wall find synergy with the outdoor scenery. To the right of the foyer, you'll enter the open concept great room and kitchen with high ceilings and a wall of windowsthat invite abundant natural light and overlook the picturesque backyard. The great room includes a dining area with built-in banquette seating and storage drawers, and it is separated from the eat-in kitchen by a sleek double-sided gas fireplace with Venetian plaster surround. The kitchen features a large island with breakfast bar, tons of storage within the mid-century modern walnut wood cabinetry, refrigerator and dishwasher panels that match the cabinetry, quartzite countertops, double wall convection ovens, induction cooktop, two pantry closets with pullout shelves, and a prep sink and cleanup sink (both with disposals). Beyond the kitchen, on the right side of the house, is a den\/common area shared by two bedrooms with a Jack-and-Jill bath. From the den you'll enter the spacious primary suite with loft. This area projects off the den to the rear, creating the home's L-shape and maximizing backyard, patio, pool, and creek views. The primary bedroom features columns of stacked floor-to-ceiling two-story windows, which flood the space with natural light, and spiral stairs that lead to the loft. A grasscloth-covered accent wall separates the bedroom from the bathroom. The primary bathroom has a double-sink mid-century modern vanity; extra large undermount soaking tub; frameless glass shower; and water closet. A sliding glass door leads from the primary suite to the sprawling travertine-paved patio and custom heated saltwater pool and spa with automatic cover. The guest powder room with custom steel vanity and tile walls can be accessed from the patio as well as from inside the house. On the opposite end of the house is a serene guest suite (bedroom and en suite bath) that overlooks the backyard and has its own patio entrance. The patio is covered along the rear of the home, and the cabana off the shed offers additional covered outdoor living space. The backyard extends beyond the patio to the tidal creek and features custom Corten steel raised bed gardens with irrigation, a gas fire pit, and a dock with floater. The creek, which is navigable from the dock within three hours on either side of high tide, meets the Wando and Cooper Rivers near their junction point. The attached carport provides covered entry to the home's mud room off the kitchen and has a level-2 EV charging station. A gas generator provides power to the whole house in the event of a power outage. The abundance of live oaks and other native evergreen trees and shrubs on the property were the foundational elements for landscape architect firm Surculus Design to create a sustainable habitat for wildlife, birds, and native pollinators. Numerous fruit trees were added (loquat, plum, pear, grapefruit, orange, and fig) along with beds of native perennial flowering plants and a perfect Gingko tree out front. The current homeowners spared no expense in the design and build of this home.
