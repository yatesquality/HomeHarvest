The primary suite measures approximately 15 x 15 and provides space for the largest furnishings with room to spare, a walk-in closet and second reach-in closet and ensuite bathroom. The secondary bedrooms are also spacious with large windows and a calming ambiance. Much of the interior has recently been repainted and the home cleaned so that it's absolutely sparkling. The screen enclosed patio overlooks an open pool so welcoming with the warm summer months approaching. Just a short walk across the driveway is the sprawling barn which the current owners utilized for extended family gatherings with one portion used for dining\/banquet space another for cooking\/prep space (remaining electric range in this space DOES convey) and then still another room for storage. Just visualize what you can do with spaces like this! They also have an enclosure for chickens (fresh eggs!) or livestock (FFA members will love this!) plus a series of raised planters for a kitchen garden and covered vehicle parking to the rear in addition to plenty of open parking. Boat & RV owners take note . . . you will not have to pay off-site storage fees again. The fenced 4-acre (MOL) manicured zoned for horses or livestock . . . ideal for those who want to keep their precious animals close!

to 1227 Darlington Oak Circle NE, a sprawling single-level executive residence nestled in the guard-gated community of Placido Bayou. This one-level floorplan rarely becomes available at this spacious square footage. No damage or flooding occurred from hurricanes Helene and Milton. As you wind through the natural Florida entrance of Placido Bayou, you will find this residence within the Estates development. As you approach the property, the grand circular driveway with a side-approach 3-car garage welcomes you. Step inside to see exquisite details including White Oak hardwood floors, floor-to-ceiling bay windows, soaring ceilings and multiple rooms for premium entertainment. The smart split floorplan provides private areas for family members and guests alike. The west side of the home is devoted to a vast primary suite which includes an independent office and a private den off the bedroom perfect for an exercise room, nursery, studio or extra TV space. The large bathroom has amazing walk-in closets, separate shower and soaking tub. On the opposite side of the home are three additional bedrooms, each with their own dedicated bathroom. Two of the additional bedrooms have their own en-suite bathrooms while the fourth bedroom could be ideal mother-in-law quarters. The open-concept kitchen flows to the family room with beautiful cabinetry, granite countertops, custom built-ins and superior quality appliances including a Sub-Zero refrigerator and Wolf appliances. The living room features a gas fireplace and French doors that lead to the brick-paved outdoor space. Beyond the living room is a personal soundproof theater room inclusive of a 4K projector and surround-sound audio, perfect for gaming or family movie nights. An adjacent bar, sink and Sub-Zero beverage refrigerator provides icing on the cake for all your entertainment needs. Easily accessed from all rooms within the home, travel outside to the ultimate pool and spa retreat featuring an outdoor kitchen. Plenty of lawn space, and a basketball pad is beyond the screened lanai which overlooks mangroves to accentuate the privacy of no backyard neighbors. The calculated renovations and fundamental updates include a brand-new tile roof (2024) and two new AC systems (2021), providing easy living for the next fortunate owner.

The property is fully gated with a stunning brick wall - replicating a wall like that would be cost prohibitive today. The huge driveway would be perfect for neighborhood basketball games or accommodate a crowd for a party. Off of the large two car garage there's a large laundry room with catering kitchen and powder bath. There are two home office spaces, two fireplaces and fantastic living spaces.

prestigious property is one of the largest farms in Grand Prix Village. A total of 3 lots covering over 14 acres with lush landscaping throughout, creates the perfect private oasis, right around the corner from the horse show. All roofs were replaced with gorgeous black, slate look tile in 2023. All the buildings were painted in a fresh white color that pops with the green landscape, and handmade cobblestone driveways and aisles. Plenty of room for all your horses with two barns, totaling 28 stalls. The main barn is centered around a beautiful courtyard and with 4 new grooming areas added to the previously existing 3 wash stalls, all the daily hustle and bustle is kept together, leaving the 20 refinished Loddon stalls quiet and peaceful for the horses to relax in. The feed room has been renovated with added stainless steel cabinetry for easy organizing. The tack room and lounge were both painted and the lounge has updated lighting and furnishings shaping a cozy place to hang out between rides. The property offers plenty of options to exercise the horses with a recently updated sand arena, featuring new irrigation, a large grass field and the walker with rubber matting throughout and brand new partitions. 9 unusually large paddocks surround the main barn and sand arena. A little more than a 2000 foot walk to the showgrounds through the back gate and bridle path. Plenty of grooms housing with 3 separate apartments adjacent to the main barn, two 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartments and one 2-bedroom, one bathroom managers apartment with a separate entrance. The second 8 stall barn comes with 8 brand new stalls, new grooming\/wash areas, a feed\/laundry room as well as a separate tack room and bathroom that allows for two separate operations. On top of the second barn, you'll find a completely renovated owners' apartment with 3 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. All 3 bedrooms and the living room have spacious balconies with serene views of the water surrounding the south end of the property. With 3 separate, updated gated entrances it's easy to keep traffic at a minimum. The entire property is covered by an upgraded security camera system including night vision cameras and remote monitoring from your cell phone. Never drop a phone call thanks to the recently added high speed internet across the property.

This gorgeous pool home has all the charm of a 1946 home but has been completely remodeled from top to bottom, including the roof, HVAC, plumbing and electrical. As you drive through the private gated entry up the recently paved driveway you'll see that the fully fenced grounds are meticulously maintained. There's plenty of covered parking under the brand new carport and storage for all of your toys in the new shed. Enjoy peace of mind for years to come knowing that a brand new standing seam metal roof was completed in 2024. The kitchen has been completely remodeled with all new cabinets, granite countertops, JennAir double ovens, gas range with hood and Thermador dishwasher. All new paint, trim, baseboards, and solid core doors throughout in 2022. New Hickory wood floors in all living areas and bedrooms installed in 2022. Tongue and groove wood ceilings in the main living areas and kitchen. Two new Train HVAC units in 2021. Tankless gas water heater in 2021. All new exterior doors, plantation blinds and wooden Roman shades on all windows and all new designer light fixtures and fans. There are three bedrooms and two full baths plus an office that could be used as a fourth bedroom. The master suite is a true retreat with a fireplace, luxury bath and huge walk-in closet with solid wood shelving. The list goes on and on.

a GEM! Located in the coveted ORTEGA FOREST neighborhood, this home has an incredible floor plan and is loaded with architectural detail & vaulted ceilings. Three of the 4 bedrooms are downstairs and there's also a huge bedroom\/bath up. The loft area would be great for a home office, kids play area or could easily be converted to a 5th bedroom if needed. The property is fully gated with a stunning brick wall - replicating a wall like that would be cost prohibitive today. The huge driveway would be perfect for neighborhood basketball games or accommodate a crowd for a party. Off of the large two car garage there's a large laundry room with catering kitchen and powder bath. There are two home office spaces, two fireplaces and fantastic living spaces. Ortega Forest is home to the amazing John Stockton elementary school and close to other private schools and clubs. Minutes to downtown Jacksonville, NAS Jax and historic Avondale, this home is a charmer!","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"4836 Yacht Club Rd","street":"4836 Yacht Club
