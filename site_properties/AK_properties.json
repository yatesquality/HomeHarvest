time is now for the opportunity to purchase this home and make it your own! This is fantastic for a remodeler, investor, or someone who wants to earn sweat equity. The home is much larger than you may think at just under 1, 600 square feet. The main part of the house is 1, 008 square feet but there was a family room and dinette addition that added so much extra space. It's a classic bungalow with 2 bedrooms on the main floor and a large 3rd bedroom on the second. The kitchen has been updated along the way with cabinets, countertops, appliances, flooring, and a pass through to the dinette area. The bedrooms and front living room feature original hardwood flooring which can be refinished to look new. The addition is great and adds a large family room area, dinette with LVP flooring, and a door to a concrete area and backyard. A unique feature is the walk-out basement which is great for taking items to the basement or using the basement as a workshop. Estimated date of updates includes water heater (2018), furnace (2011), C\/A (2005), windows (2012). Roof (unknown), 100 amp electric service.

Privacy & Neighborhood. This 1.16 acre lot is nestled at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac in Bath Township and the award-winning Revere School District. It features a classic American red barn with interior lighting & a loft for extra storage space, two Norway Spruce Trees, five thriving Spruce Trees that serve as a natural perimeter for the privacy in back of the lot (and ready for your Holiday decor!), and several young planted Spruce Trees that will further enhance lot privacy and assist in the preservation of the natural ecosystem for years to come. The gorgeous creek with a curated walkway runs through the lot, an iconic symbol of rural tradition. The quaint, yet sturdy brick garden path conveniently stretches across the length of the lot on one side. A limestone block retaining wall supports the privacy perimeter of natural trees between the adjacent parcel. A white stair railing, steps leading down to the brick pathway, and mushroom lighting all further enhance the visual appeal of the lot that is situated in an idyllic location with minimal traffic and negligible street noise.","style":"LAND","full_street_line":"V\/L Cliff Spur Dr","street":"V\/L Cliff Spur Dr","unit":null,"city":"Akron","state":"OH","zip_code":"44333","beds":null,"full_baths":null,"half_baths":null,"sqft":null,"year_built":null,"days_on_mls":188,"list_price":135000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2024-11-08","sold_price":125000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-15","assessed_value":13965,"estimated_value":null,"tax":794,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":794,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":13965,"total":13965}},{"year":2023,"tax":739,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":13965,"total":13965}},{"year":2022,"tax":716,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":11638,"total":11638}},{"year":2021,"tax":709,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":11638,"total":11638}},{"year":2020,"tax":695,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":11638,"total":11638}},{"year":2019,"tax":846,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":13293,"total":13293}},{"year":2018,"tax":836,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":13293,"total":13293}},{"year":2017,"tax":839,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":13293,"total":13293}},{"year":2016,"tax":876,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":13293,"total":13293}},{"year":2015,"tax":845,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":13293,"total":13293}},{"year":2014,"tax":823,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":13293,"total":13293}},{"year":2013,"tax":1633,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":26712,"total":26712}},{"year":2012,"tax":1637,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":26712,"total":26712}},{"year":2011,"tax":1635,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":26712,"total":26712}},{"year":2010,"tax":1500,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":27825,"total":27825}},{"year":2008,"tax":1511,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":27825,"total":27825}},{"year":2007,"tax":1004,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":18921,"total":18921}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":50530,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":41.175185,"longitude":-81.66264,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Summit","fips_code":"39153","stories":null,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"2870484","agent_name":"Nick","agent_email":"nick@zawitzteam.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"4405677068"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-NEOH-2016000538","agent_nrds_id":"657020725","broker_id":null,"broker_name":null,"builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":null,"office_mls_set":"O-NEOH-20552","office_name":"The Agency Cleveland Northcoast","office_email":"cleveland@theagencyre.com","office_phones":[{"number":"2164157080","type":null,"primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"Revere Local School District","primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m2382595175od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m2382595175od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m4017549074od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m3846268374od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m2753073896od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m2513010888od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m201450142od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m1908557891od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m779070819od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m3196507011od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m426313577od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m2360797406od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/cdcc134fd56363baeb8033b9be6dfccal-m3682220794od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/207-Kenilworth-Dr_Akron_OH_44313_M38796-74624","property_id":"3879674624","listing_id":"2980053614","mls":"NEOH","mls_id":"5111426","status":"SOLD","text":"Pristine Castle Park brick 2 story colonial with hardwood floors throughout and BEAUTIFUL wood work throughout!

sleep on this one - 412 Newell Avenue is the kind of find that disappears fast in Goodyear Heights. This updated 3-bedroom, 1-bathroom home has that perfect mix of charm, comfort, and upgrades that make it completely move-in ready. Right away, you'll notice the love that's gone into this place- from the freshly redone master bedroom in 2024 to the soft carpet added in 2020. Natural light pours in through newer windows, giving the whole space a warm, welcoming feel. The eat-in kitchen has a newer stove and just enough room to make it the heart of the home. Big updates? Already handled. You've got an updated central air system, a recently installed hot water tank, and an updated electrical panel- all adding peace of mind. The bathroom has been given a fresh, modern touch, and the roof's estimated to be around 10 years old, so you're in good shape there, too. Kick back on the covered front porch, enjoy the quiet neighborhood vibe, and rest easy knowing a home warranty is already included. You're close to shopping, restaurants, and everything else you need. This spot is priced right and ready to go- don't wait around. Schedule your showing before someone else beats you to it.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"412 Newell Ave","street":"412 Newell

The front of the home offers a covered front porch perfect for relaxing. While the property is priced to sell as-is, there are a few repairs needed to unlock its full potential. The main sewer line was replaced in 2024. The basement foundation has repairs that need to be made. A licensed professional has already provided a quote for replacement in the compromised area (see supplements). Currently, a floor jack is in place for stabilization. The half bath toilet has been shut off and will need to be replaced. Most floors throughout the home will benefit from some TLC.

The lower level has a large 38x14 Ft. recreation room with 2nd fireplace and the other half of this level is ample storage, half bath and laundry. The home has many newer windows and the furnace & water heater appear newer as well. Your personal touches & renovations (mostly cosmetic) will be needed to transform this into a very comfortable home. The lot size is somewhat irregular and there is not much of a back yard so take that into consideration when adding this home to your list.
