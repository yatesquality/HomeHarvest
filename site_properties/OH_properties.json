Architectural Gem located on one of Shaker Height's first established streets has been renovated to the highest standards while preserving the original details. Designed and built by Phillip Small to reflect an English style cottage among the grand Shaker mansions of the era, this modest home abounds with charm and functionality. From the moment you step inside the foyer with original millwork, you are drawn into a spacious yet cozy living room featuring beamed ceilings, built-in bookcases and a sandstone gas fireplace. The current homeowners renovated the kitchen down to the studs, adding in cheerful cabinets, quartz counters and high end appliances. This massive project improved the flow of the home, opening the kitchen into the dining room. Step out to a screened in porch with flagstone patio overlooking spacious backyard with mature plants and perennial garden. Three spacious bedrooms on the second floor, one with a bonus room that steps out to an open air porch. The primary bedroom and ensuite features a gorgeous updated bathroom with two walk in closets, one is large enough to function as a home office. Central air, on 2nd and 3rd floor only, was installed in 2016. Third floor has an additional two bedrooms and full bathroom. Exterior improvements included custom built shutters with working hardware, a newer concrete driveway and an electric car hookup for the garage.

The 15x14 master suite features a walk in closet and one of the full baths. There are 2 bedrooms on the main floor and 1 up. A 2 car attached garage with a storage closet for some of the extras and a mechanical room for the furnace, softener, and well pump. More updates and additions by the current owner include a Kohler whole house generator (Lake Contracting) and gutter guards installed late 2017. The range and refrigerator were replaced in 2020. The seller will give a $500 Menards card to allow for a new dishwasher. The current dishwasher does not appear to be draining properly. Leased propane tank from Ferrell gas. The riding lawn mower can be purchased for $1000.

in the car and take a drive to the country! Don't miss this cleared, slightly rolling, lightly wooded 5 acre building lot with a large pond! Its conveniently located within minutes of Route 11, Route 46 and Route 90, but tucked back on a private secondary road. The approximately 3\/4 acre pond is nicely situated off to one side of the lot, allowing plenty of options to choose from when situating your new home and improvements. With the generous frontage, your built-in privacy is guaranteed. Imagine the fun of having your own pond - fish and swim in the warm months - get out of the house and learn to ice skate for the winter! You can also use it for your household potable water supply, and you may want to look in to pond sourced geothermal heat systems. Pond installation costs have gone up considerably - so you're saving money already! Seller does not know how deep it is. (Note: some septic components are already in place and may possibly be used - check in with the Local Health Department for more information).","style":"LAND","full_street_line":"2727 Sylvia

on 2 peaceful acres in Pleasant Local Schools, 3998 Larue-Prospect Rd S offers a rare blend of space, character, and opportunity. This 3-bedroom, 2-bath ranch includes an attached 2-car garage, a partially finished basement, and a layout that's both functional and full of potential. Recent upgrades like a new furnace and A\/C system (2019) provide a great starting point for your modern touches. The heart of the home is ready to be reimagined - whether you're looking for cozy comfort or open-concept living. What truly sets this property apart is the hidden in-law suite tucked just behind the detached garage. With its own side entrance, full bathroom, and separate furnace (2019), it's a perfect setup for guests, a home office, or private retreat. The detached garage still offers two full bays for parking or storage, plus an extra shed for tools and toys. And with wide-open yard space and scenic views, there's plenty of room to garden, entertain, or simply enjoy the quiet of country living - all just minutes from town. Homes with this kind of potential don't come along often. Bring your vision, and make it your own.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"3998 Larue Prospect Rd S","street":"3998 Larue Prospect

on 2 peaceful acres in Pleasant Local Schools, 3998 Larue-Prospect Rd S offers a rare blend of space, character, and opportunity. This 3-bedroom, 2-bath ranch includes an attached 2-car garage, a partially finished basement, and a layout that's both functional and full of potential. Recent upgrades like a new furnace and A\/C system (2019) provide a great starting point for your modern touches. The heart of the home is ready to be reimagined - whether you're looking for cozy comfort or open-concept living. What truly sets this property apart is the hidden in-law suite tucked just behind the detached garage. With its own side entrance, full bathroom, and separate furnace (2019), it's a perfect setup for guests, a home office, or private retreat. The detached garage still offers two full bays for parking or storage, plus an extra shed for tools and toys. And with wide-open yard space and scenic views, there's plenty of room to garden, entertain, or simply enjoy the quiet of country living - all just minutes from town. Homes with this kind of potential don't come along often. Bring your vision, and make it your own.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"3998 Larue Prospect Rd S","street":"3998 Larue Prospect

Coming in at just under 3000 sq ft, this home offers versatility in layout that is sure to meet your needs. Imagine waking up and enjoying your favorite beverage on your large back deck with no rear neighbors and a wooded view. Cooking will be enjoyable again in your gourmet kitchen (with granite countertops) and entertaining will be a breeze with a formal dining area and a breakfast nook both open to the large first floor living room and kitchen. You could also set up a home theater system and host movie nights in the large, finished basement recreation room--a closet has been added for extra storage. Upstairs you will find a large ensuite with a walk-in closet as well as two other generously sized bedrooms and a huge loft space--perfect for a play or office area. Were you really looking for a 4-bedroom house? The loft space upstairs could be finished as a 4th bedroom and there is still finishable space in the basement that would have egress. The roof is only 2.5 years old and the deck is already scheduled to be repainted. All the carpet is brand new this month.

The kitchen island is solid but portable and can be used as a coffee bar in any room. With a vaulted ceiling, skylights and ample room for a dining table and big comfy living room furniture, the great room creates an inviting space that is flooded with sunlight. From the four-season room, enjoy a view of the private, fully fenced backyard. A fireplace adds to the tranquility. The manicured gardens are a great backdrop for backyard entertainment. With a two-tiered deck, patio, shed and water feature, the yard is outstanding. When entering from the 2-car attached garage, a generous sized laundry room is an ideal drop zone. Muddy boots, muddy pets, no problem! The roof was replaced in 2019. The furnace, A\/C and water heater were replaced in 2013.

to 2716 Hunter's Ridge, located in the heart of Twinsburg. When entering the home I felt it to be very spacious, open and inviting. The kitchen, with all of its granite counter space, pantry, dinette area, & family room were definitely designed with entertaining in mind. The living room lends itself to reading, listening to music, a room to retreat to. The 2nd floor offers 4 spacious bedrooms along with a loft, 2 full baths & laundry room. How nice is it to only have take dish towels to the 1st floor. The Master bedroom has the wow factor... his and her closets, spacious master bath, along with enough room to create a sitting room area. Then you have the loft which could be an office, a TV area, a craft room, an exercise area, endless possibilities. The lower level offers a partially finished area, (15' wide x 41'deep) along with an unfinished storage area. The garage is 23' feet deep, makes for a roomy garage. As if all this wasn't enough you have a great view out the rear of the home, woods, green space. This home is centrally located to Twinsburg schools, library, Rec Center, Twinsburg Water Park, police & fire. Then their is the proximity to freeways, you are minutes to the freeway and the turnpike, along with Starbucks! Twinsburg along with surrounding communities offers many restaurants, shopping, parks, etc.The Cleveland Clinic, along with University Hospital both have facilities in Twinsburg. Then their is the Amphitheatre which holds summer concerts - Rock the Park series. And lets not forget about Twins Day. The home has 2 years left on the structural warranty, 30 year roof shingles when built along with energy efficient windows. But don't take my word for it, schedule a time to view the home.
