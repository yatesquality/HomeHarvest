Just minutes from White Rock Lake, the Arboretum, and Lakeland Hills Park, this home sits on an established, tree-lined street that feels like an insiders secret. The layout has been intelligently redesigned to maximize flow, with the reframing of the flex office or bedroom, full laundry with custom cabinetry, and a designer half bath all tucked seamlessly off the main living area. Original hardwoods have been beautifully restored in the private quarters, while oversized tile flooring grounds the open kitchen and living space. Every surface and system has been upgraded from PVC plumbing and electrical wiring to new insulation and HVAC allowing the aesthetic to shine without compromise. The kitchen is a showpiece with a 7-foot quartz island with waterfall edge, high-end soft-close cabinetry, and a custom layout that balances minimalism with maximum storage. These same refined touches carry through to the bathrooms, where curated tile work, sleek quartz counters, designer lighting, and custom vanities showcase a consistent attention to detail. The primary bath features a glass-enclosed walk-in shower, while the guest bath offers dual vanities with elevated finishes. Energy-efficient, gridless windows invite natural light, while the expansive backyard offers a 26 by 14-foot covered patio, custom landscaping, and a new board-on-board fence for privacy. A 24-foot covered front porch nods to neighborly charm. Designer lighting, timeless materials, and cohesive craftsmanship throughout. This home isnt just updated...its elevated.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"8336 Baumgarten Dr","street":"8336 Baumgarten

meets new in this 4 bed 3.5 bath new construction single-family home in the well-sought after Hollywood Santa Monica neighborhood. Situated in a conservation district where new construction is rare, this Lakewood-elementary zoned house has all of the modern amenities with the added charm of one of Dallas most coveted neighborhoods. A turfed backyard allows for a low-maintenance lifestyle and the open floor plan brings in plenty of natural light throughout the home. Featuring custom trim and woodwork throughout, this home has been thoughtfully upgraded since being built in 2020. In addition to the many perks of the home, Lindsley Park is just steps away acting as a second backyard as is access to the Santa Fe Trail for easy access to White Rock Lake or the many miles of Dallas biking, running, and walking trails. Not to mention walking distance to Tenison Golf Course and Samuel Grand Tennis Facility!

single-story property is in the vibrant Trinity Groves areaone of Dallass most sought-after and rapidly developing neighborhoods. Surrounded by new builds and modern developments, this lot offers prime potential for investors and developers looking to capitalize on the area's growth. The existing structure, with its brick and stone exterior and wrought iron fencing, likely requires significant repairs and may be better suited for demolition to build a modern property. This property is being sold as-is, subject to court approval. The Realtor has been appointed as Receiver by the 134th Judicial District Court in Dallas County, Texas, and holds sole authority to accept or reject offers, counteroffer, execute sales contracts, and sign deeds. Offers require final court approval. No warranties, expressed or implied, are provided. According to Dallas Central Appraisal District (DCAD), the home is described as a four-bedroom, two-bath property with 1, 479 square feet, built in 1983, though this date is likely inaccurate. The Receiver relies on DCAD. Buyers and agents must verify all details, including measurements, schools, zoning, and property condition. This is a rare opportunity to develop or invest in one of Dallas's most desirable neighborhoods.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"1720 Morris St","street":"1720 Morris St","unit":null,"city":"Dallas","state":"TX","zip_code":"75212","beds":4,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":null,"sqft":1479,"year_built":1983,"days_on_mls":131,"list_price":159000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-01-01","sold_price":null,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-12","assessed_value":215210,"estimated_value":159203,"tax":4810,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":4810,"assessment":{"building":71210,"land":144000,"total":215210}},{"year":2023,"tax":4368,"assessment":{"building":103950,"land":86400,"total":190350}},{"year":2022,"tax":4759,"assessment":{"building":103950,"land":86400,"total":190350}},{"year":2021,"tax":4210,"assessment":{"building":87600,"land":72000,"total":159600}},{"year":2020,"tax":2568,"assessment":{"building":46670,"land":48000,"total":94670}},{"year":2019,"tax":2541,"assessment":{"building":44970,"land":48000,"total":92970}},{"year":2018,"tax":1662,"assessment":{"building":44030,"land":14400,"total":58430}},{"year":2017,"tax":1588,"assessment":{"building":44030,"land":14400,"total":58430}},{"year":2016,"tax":1395,"assessment":{"building":43640,"land":7680,"total":51320}},{"year":2015,"tax":1826,"assessment":{"building":58920,"land":7680,"total":66600}},{"year":2014,"tax":1820,"assessment":{"building":58920,"land":7680,"total":66600}},{"year":2013,"tax":1813,"assessment":{"building":58920,"land":7680,"total":66600}},{"year":2012,"tax":1812},{"year":2011,"tax":1977},{"year":2010,"tax":1946},{"year":2009,"tax":1918},{"year":2008,"tax":2564},{"year":2007,"tax":2571}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":4792,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":32.783152,"longitude":-96.84731,"neighborhoods":"Homestead Manor, West Dallas, Los Altos","county":"Dallas","fips_code":"48113","stories":1,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"719338","agent_name":"Katy Hubener","agent_email":"Katy@CrescentRealEstateGroup.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"9722969400"},{"ext":null,"primary":false,"type":"Fax","number":"9722969492"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-NTTX-0521061","agent_nrds_id":"798524734","broker_id":"3624130","broker_name":"Crescent Real Estate Group -

Grab a frozen custard at Andys, dinner on the patio at Cedar & Vine or settle in for cold one at Vector Brewing. Walk the tree-lined streets and get to know your neighbors. Its a Block Party kind of place. Lake Highlands Elementary is literally around the corner and in the fall, the sounds of Friday Night Lights fill the air. With this home, youre not just part of the neighborhood, youre part of the community.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"10006 Lakemere Dr","street":"10006 Lakemere Dr","unit":null,"city":"Dallas","state":"TX","zip_code":"75238","beds":3,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":null,"sqft":1564,"year_built":1957,"days_on_mls":2,"list_price":625000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-05-07","sold_price":null,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-09","assessed_value":511240,"estimated_value":573400,"tax":11978,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":11978,"assessment":{"building":161240,"land":350000,"total":511240}},{"year":2023,"tax":10054,"assessment":{"building":139780,"land":275000,"total":414780}},{"year":2021,"tax":9957,"assessment":{"building":248090,"land":110000,"total":358090}},{"year":2020,"tax":10101,"assessment":{"building":248090,"land":110000,"total":358090}},{"year":2019,"tax":10175,"assessment":{"building":248090,"land":110000,"total":358090}},{"year":2018,"tax":9167,"assessment":{"building":200430,"land":110000,"total":310430}},{"year":2017,"tax":7677,"assessment":{"building":171570,"land":100000,"total":271570}},{"year":2016,"tax":6955,"assessment":{"building":156020,"land":90000,"total":246020}},{"year":2015,"tax":6701,"assessment":{"building":149360,"land":90000,"total":239360}},{"year":2014,"tax":5636,"assessment":{"building":141960,"land":60000,"total":201960}},{"year":2013,"tax":5616,"assessment":{"building":141960,"land":60000,"total":201960}},{"year":2012,"tax":5656},{"year":2011,"tax":5616},{"year":2010,"tax":5636},{"year":2009,"tax":5283},{"year":2008,"tax":4938},{"year":2007,"tax":4626}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":8799,"price_per_sqft":null,"latitude":32.874926,"longitude":-96.712513,"neighborhoods":"Lake Highlands, Northeast Dallas, Lake Ridge Estates North","county":"Dallas","fips_code":"48113","stories":1,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":2,"agent_id":"3862923","agent_name":"Nikki Barringer","agent_email":"nikkibarringer@ebby.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"BUSINESS_MOBILE","number":"2143947840"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-NTTX-0725946","agent_nrds_id":"798578734","broker_id":"2979775","broker_name":"Ebby Halliday Realtors","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"2937208","office_mls_set":"O-NTTX-DPMA04","office_name":"Dave Perry-Miller -

Rich wood floors and clean, contemporary paint colors greet you as you enter. The eye-catching kitchen was remodeled in 2024. It's highlighted by sleek modern countertops, white cabinetry, tile backsplash, stainless steel appliances, a gas range, a breakfast bar, and new luxury vinyl plank flooring. The welcoming primary living area is flooded by natural light thanks to the oversized windows. Escape to the private primary suite, which is set up as its own private wing of the home. The primary bedroom has a pair of French doors, giving you access to the back deck and incredible backyard (more on that later!) The remodeled primary bathroom is immaculate! It comes complete with dual quartz vanities, porcelain tile flooring and walls, a frameless walk-in rain shower with a second detachable head, and a garden tub. At the end of the hall, a converted walk-in closet gives you an abundance of storage space. The second bedroom comes with its own ensuite bath with a walk-in shower! It's a perfect guest suite. A spacious utility room was added to the house and gives you a dedicated place to do laundry. Escape to the scenic, one-of-a-kind landscaped backyard, which is a nature lover's dream! Enjoy the park-like setting from the attached deck or the detached patio area with stone features, perfect for gathering around a fire pit with those closest to you. Pick fresh fruit from your own private garden, including persimmon, peaches, pears, and figs. Your private greenhouse will help you enjoy gardening year-round. A beautiful creek runs along the backyard and two bridges lead over the creek to additional play space. A workshop-shed-studio sits out back and has electricity, giving you endless options for dance, gym, work, or storage. The sidewalks and driveway were also recently redone to ensure long-term safety and performance!","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"2122 Blake Ave","street":"2122 Blake

to 5526 Del Roy. This Texas modern home is one of the prettiest in Preston Hollow. As you pull up be amazed by the professional landscaping. Black Tejas borders lead you to the front entrance made entirely of cast stone. The cast stone is perfectly set against the beige brick which is framed by dark painted trim & black framed windows. As you enter the double steel doors you are greeted with 25 tall entryway & stairs. The formal dining room is on the left & opens to the large family room. The kitchen, breakfast area & family room are all open & allow for easy flow for guests. The kitchen cabinets are a rich coffee color framing white cabinets & stainless steel appliances. Large sliding doors lead off the family room to the screened & heated patio area with fireplace. Its going to be tough to figure out where the best place is to watch football on the weekend. The landscaping in the back of the house rivals the front with plenty of room for a pool. Turf was recently added from fence to fence. Inside the master bedroom suite hides in a cozy corner of the house. Two additional bedrooms on the first floor. Upstairs there is 2nd master suite plus 2 additional bedrooms with ensuite bathes. A large loft area & media room complete the 2nd story.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"5526 Del Roy Dr","street":"5526 Del Roy

One of the few two-story homes on the block, 1111 N Edgefield sits majestically on a raised hillside lot framed by long-lived trees. The current owner has been at Edgefield for almost 25 years and has been a wonderful steward of the property. In recent years (2021), the roof on the house and the rear entry garage were replaced and the homes electrical wiring and electrical panel were redone in 2024. The exterior woodwork was repainted in 2022 and the downstairs rooms were repainted in 2024. The second floor HVAC was replaced in 2021 and the sewer line was replaced around 2000. One of the joys of this home is how intact many of the original architectural details remain. The woodwork in the front entry and the stairwell are beautiful examples of Arts and Crafts styling, as are the leaded glass cabinets in the dining room and living room. The living room is two steps down from the entry hall and features a Rookwood tile fireplace. The entry and living rooms retain their original proportions keeping the commodious 1925 floor plan intact. The kitchen was added later and it has 50s era, Geneva brand, steel cabinets, a white tile backsplash and top-of-the line appliances including a Subzero refrigerator freezer and a Viking stove and oven. On the second floor, there are four bedrooms and one bath. The second floor arrangement lends itself to turning one of the bedrooms into a new primary ensuite bath.

A custom, extra-wide steel pivot door sets the stage for whats inside: natural oak flooring, museum-finish walls, architectural windows, and a sleek, minimalist kitchen with floating shelves and clean-lined cabinetry. The split-level dining and family rooms enhance the spatial experience, creating separation while maintaining openness. The primary suite is accessed through a striking atrium-style hallway, with its own patio access and a spa-inspired bath featuring a soaking tub, oversized shower, and dual vanities, all thoughtfully designed for function and refinement. Out back, a professionally landscaped yard is anchored by a terra-cotta tiled patio with a breeze block wall and a custom cantilevered patio cover, ideal for entertaining or quiet evenings overlooking the 10-foot splash pool. Exterior lighting extends the ambiance into the evening, while a motorized sliding gate opens to a covered parking space. Additional features include foam insulation, new plumbing and electrical systems, a tankless water heater, and a new roof, delivering a high-efficiency home thats as practical as it is well-crafted.
