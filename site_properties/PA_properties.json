contract-accepting backup offers. The McKaig House built by Sarasota originals Logan and Currin sits on over half an acre and is one of the few remaining crown jewels of Cherokee Park. The home has been impeccably maintained keeping as much of the 1930s character and materials as possible. Recently, Perrone Construction was used for the primary bedroom renovation and solarium style kitchen\/great room addition. The huge entry foyer, with elegant solid oak staircase, highlights the high ceilings, original plaster walls, wood moldings and original wood floors that run through the home. The formal dining room features antique brass sconces and French doors leading to the screened porch. The living room has the original wood-burning fireplace with a gas hookup. All rooms are bathed in loads of sunlight. The custom kitchen is a gourmet's delight with a nearly 8-foot-long quartzite island, custom Campbell walnut wood cabinets and large pantry. The 60-inch Wolfe gas range, two 36-inch Sub-Zero refrigerators, two Asko dishwashers and Sub-Zero ice maker will delight any cook. There is also a mud room\/pantry adjacent to the kitchen. On the main level, the main suite is complete with two custom walk-in closets and a primary bath featuring J. Tribble vanities with mystery white quartzite, walk-in shower and free-standing tub. Upstairs there are three additional bedrooms, two that share a guest bath and an en-suite guest room. There is also a huge, floored, attic space above the kitchen\/great room. The attention to detail is unrivaled with nothing being overlooked. The long Tabby ribbon drive leads to the detached two-car garage complete with an original casita-style bath and bedroom, fifth bedroom. Bring your pets as there's plenty of room to roam with the fenced yard with 100-year-old trees and the lushly landscaped backyard is ample enough for any pool imaginable. Feel secure with impact windows, generator, zone X flood zone and evacuation zone level D. There was no water intrusion from any past storm, according to the owner. Cherokee Park is one of the desirable neighborhoods in Sarasota. Visit, ride or take your golf cart to the Southside district, Sarasota Memorial Hospital, Selby Gardens, Sarasota Bayfront, downtown Sarasota and of course the world's number one beach, Siesta Key. The possibilities are endless. Don't delay in seeing this exquisite home. It's seldom this style of home on this size lot comes to market.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"1744 South Dr","street":"1744 South

This is one of only 55 homes in the Evergreen Park neighborhood that is adjacent to the Legacy Trail. A true split plan with living, dining, kitchen breakfast nook, family room, and inside utility makes this a very desirable floorplan. Enjoy the large 23-foot screened lanai that looks out onto a spacious private fenced-in yard. You will have plenty of room for a pool, outside BBQ area, or just a great yard for the family and pets. The primary suite has a walk-in closet, en-suite bath with double vanities, and slider access to the screened lanai. Two guest bedrooms and a guest bath off of the family room have a corridor entry that can be closed off with its pocket door to give a private en-suite feel and easy access to the garage, inside utility, and back yard. Perfect space if you need a multi-generational home. A few of the updates needed for peace of mind are a new roof in 2022, a replaced septic tank in 2018, a 16-seer ac system in 2017 and they kept the well for irrigation so you don't have to worry about high water bills while taking care of your yard.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"4434 Meadow Creek Cir","street":"4434 Meadow Creek Cir","unit":null,"city":"Sarasota","state":"FL","zip_code":"34233","beds":3,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":null,"sqft":1839,"year_built":1984,"days_on_mls":144,"list_price":500000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2024-12-16","sold_price":460000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-09","assessed_value":387700,"estimated_value":481000,"tax":5121,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":5121,"assessment":{"building":258600,"land":129100,"total":387700}},{"year":2023,"tax":5281,"assessment":{"building":286200,"land":119000,"total":405200}},{"year":2022,"tax":2519,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":205940}},{"year":2021,"tax":2511,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":199942}},{"year":2020,"tax":2506,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":197181}},{"year":2019,"tax":2408,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":192748}},{"year":2018,"tax":3225,"assessment":{"building":145000,"land":79400,"total":224400}},{"year":2017,"tax":1556,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":124846}},{"year":2016,"tax":1543,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":122278}},{"year":2015,"tax":1565,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":121428}},{"year":2014,"tax":1557,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":120464}},{"year":2013,"tax":1553,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":118684}},{"year":2012,"tax":1513,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":116700}},{"year":2011,"tax":1518,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":118648}},{"year":2010,"tax":1548,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":116895}},{"year":2009,"tax":1478,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":113822}},{"year":2008,"tax":1457,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":113708}},{"year":2007,"tax":1560,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":null,"total":110396}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":10937,"price_per_sqft":250,"latitude":27.287909,"longitude":-82.486235,"neighborhoods":"Evergreen Park","county":"Sarasota","fips_code":"12115","stories":1,"hoa_fee":25,"parking_garage":2,"agent_id":"875544","agent_name":"Maurice Menager","agent_email":"lead@michaelsaunders.info","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"9413493444"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"9412388119"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-ORFL-281503595","agent_nrds_id":"281503595","broker_id":"1650247","broker_name":"Michael Saunders & Company","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"927876","office_mls_set":"O-ORFL-281502395","office_name":"Michael Saunders & Company - Siesta Key Office","office_email":"lead@michaelsaunders.info","office_phones":[{"number":"9413493444","type":"Office","primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"Sarasota","primary_photo":null,"alt_photos":null,"photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/3235-51st-St_Sarasota_FL_34235_M59219-15218","property_id":"5921915218","listing_id":"2980466514","mls":"ORFL","mls_id":"A4648534","status":"SOLD","text":"Here is a Great Choice for a Future Build Site in the Desirable Desoto Lakes \/ Desoto Acres area!

contract-accepting backup offers. This designer-owned, West of Trail home, is the perfect blend of beauty, elegance, and quality. Purchased in 2018, it has since been a creative work in progress and has undergone a complete transformation both inside and out. In a world where many believe that bigger is better, this creation plays on the Tiffany ideal that good things come in small packages and is truly a rare fine in our local real estate market. Built in 2006, the home features an open great room floorplan with vaulted pecky cypress ceilings, a gas fireplace, luxury Coretec wide plank flooring, a stunning and expansive gourmet kitchen featuring Wolf appliances, Delta Trinsic fixtures, custom cabinets by Cabinet Design Studios, walnut countertops, and a massive island with a 3-inch quartz top and a solid walnut wood base with extra cabinets. Both bathrooms have undergone a complete makeover consisting of upscale fixtures and high-end marble installed by European Marble. All three bedrooms have custom closets designed and installed by Closet Tec. The back pergola and roof were added in 2019 to keep the harsh sunlight off the custom mahogany doors which were installed keeping with the Spanish revival feel. A new tankless water heater was added in 2024 and the AC unit was replaced in 2019. The front stairs were replaced and designed to complement the custom mahogany front door. The extensive landscaping has gone through two major phases and include custom trellises, window boxes, an irrigation system, and Haven low voltage lighting which can be operated by an app and colors can be adjusted. A new motorized wrought-iron gate was added at the driveway entry in 2021. Peace of mind is prioritized with Hurricane impact V Guard windows throughout, a new flat roof in 2018, and a newly added Kohler full house gas generator.

Live here and you will also be near cultural & educational institutions like the Ringling Museum of Art & Design, Asolo Theatre of Performing Arts, the Sarasota Ballet, Ringling College of Art and Design and USF! This is a rare opportunity to own the Palm model with a fully enclosed Florida room making it one of the larger homes in the community. Another important upgrade is a complete set of impact resistant, insulated, hurricane windows. These were custom made including the clerestory windows in the great room which has a vaulted ceiling. There is a tiled front porch big enough to visit with neighbors, a foyer entry and a large eat in kitchen. The chefs among us will appreciate the natural gas range and the moveable, butcher block island. A colorful, tiled backsplash adds some whimsey. Floors throughout are a combination of an oak laminate and ceramic tile. The primary bedroom is an en-suite with a walk-in closet, low threshold shower and direct access to the Florida room. The second bedroom is currently set up with a Murphy bed and the bath has a tub for those wanting a soak. The Palm model also has an interior utility room with storage cabinets, a washer, and a dryer. Out back you'll find a cozy paver patio with a walkway leading around to the carport. The long views are of the lush, well-maintained grounds which retain a very natural look and feel. This property is being sold with contents as pictured.

As a single-family home in the maintenance-free Pine Trace community, it provides a unique opportunity to enjoy a carefree lifestyle in the heart of Sarasota. The recent storms flooding highlighted the home's resilience, as it remained dry and is located outside of all evacuation zones. The HOA takes care of yard maintenance, roof repairs (new in 2023), and the home's exterior, including paint. HVAC was replaced in 2024, providing additional peace of mind. Insurance is also included in the monthly fee, eliminating any potential challenges in acquiring coverage. The open floor plan with vaulted ceilings creates a spacious and welcoming atmosphere.

This modern townhome features three bedrooms, two-and-a-half bathrooms, and a great room. Immediately inside, youre greeted by a powder room for guests, and a one-car garage for ready-to-go access to the beaches, minutes away. The foyer opens up into an oversized great room, creating a functional space that allows you to flow from kitchen to great room to outside. A kitchen lines one wall with tons of counter space. Sliding glass doors near the caf open out to the lanai and blue Sarasota skies. Youll love quiet mornings spent in the yard sipping coffee. The second story houses all the bedrooms, and when you reach the top of the staircase, you enter a long hallway. An owners suite is a huge highlight with spacious walk-in closets to store all your clothing, accessories, luggage, and more. The peaceful owners bath offers privacy with a walk-in shower, linen closet, and dual vanities. Another door opens to a walk-in laundry room; youll love having all your laundry upstairs and easy to access. You'll never again have to walk downstairs with a heavy basket! Walking farther down the plush carpeted hallway, there is a second and third bedroom. Turn these into side-by-side rooms or utilize one bedroom as an office or guest room. Both bedrooms have beautiful large windows for cascading sunshine, and you will love the view. A second bath sets at the end of the hallway for more privacy.","style":"TOWNHOMES","full_street_line":"254 Via Anina Dr","street":"254 Via Anina Dr","unit":null,"city":"Sarasota","state":"FL","zip_code":"34243","beds":3,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":1,"sqft":1853,"year_built":2024,"days_on_mls":280,"list_price":399999,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2024-07-24","sold_price":365000,"last_sold_date":"2025-04-30","assessed_value":null,"estimated_value":392984,"tax":null,"tax_history":null,"new_construction":true,"lot_sqft":1980,"price_per_sqft":197,"latitude":27.382437,"longitude":-82.504517,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Sarasota","fips_code":"12115","stories":2,"hoa_fee":206,"parking_garage":1,"agent_id":"3686717","agent_name":"Elizabeth Stephens","agent_email":"edrack1@yahoo.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Home","number":"4074366109"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-ORFL-035840035","agent_nrds_id":null,"broker_id":"3686712","broker_name":"Floriwest Realty Group, Llc - BDX","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"3686714","office_mls_set":"O-ORFL-035840033","office_name":"M\/I Homes","office_email":"wduderstandt@mihomes.com","office_phones":[{"number":"9412252111","type":"Other","primary":true,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":"Sarasota","primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a0cfd91ac655fd0e24fb10cd9e5dbd26l-m1026910436od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/a0cfd91ac655fd0e24fb10cd9e5dbd26l-m1026910436od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/5020-Willow-Leaf-Way_Sarasota_FL_34241_M57305-28802","property_id":"5730528802","listing_id":"2976994458","mls":"ORFL","mls_id":"A4634551","status":"SOLD","text":"Under contract-accepting backup offers.

Situated on a sprawling almost 1-acre lot with no HOA or CDD fees, this property offers unparalleled freedom and functionality for families of all sizes. Boasting 2, 209 square feet of living space, this home features a thoughtfully designed split layout. The main residence includes 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. There is also a 1-bedroom, 1-bathroom accessory dwelling unit or in-law suite with kitchen facilities, new vinyl plank flooring, and a private entrance, all of which provides ideal accommodations for family, guests, renters, or a home office. Though the original home was built earlier, the majority of the living space, the in-law suite, and garage were added in 2004, and all are solid cinder-block construction. Neither the house nor garage sustained any water or wind damage during the past 10 years of current ownership, and owners believe there was none prior. Updated survey and elevation certificate were completed in Feb. 2025. Structure is in an X Zone so lenders will not require flood insurance. The main kitchen is a chefs delight with new granite countertops, crisp white cabinetry, and ceramic tile flooring that extends throughout the main living areas. Adjacent to the kitchen, the large, open living and dining spaces are perfect for hosting gatherings and creating lasting memories. Step outside to your personal oasis including bamboo stands as well as fig and mango trees. The expansive covered lanai was built in 2018 and leads to a sparkling swimming pool under a screened cage, both added in 2021perfect for entertaining or relaxing in the Florida sunshine. The yard is fully fenced and there are dog-doors from the residence, lanai, and in-law suite, providing full but controlled access for furry family members. Recent updates ensure peace of mind: the roof was replaced in 2022, one of the two air conditioning units was replaced in 2023, and the water heater was replaced in 2019.
