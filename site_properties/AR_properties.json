Large windows, original hardwood floors, fireplace, and vintage lights add charm & ambiance. Partially updated with new interior paint, new exterior trim paint, some new windows, and new 3-prong GFCI outlets throughout on the 2-wire circuits. New roof in 2022. This is an older home priced as-is with all the charm, quirks, and possibilities you can imagine with original Kitchen cabinets and Bathrooms last updated over a decade ago. There is a 2-car garage, a large back patio, and shared driveway with the neighbors.","style":"SINGLE_FAMILY","full_street_line":"500 N Vinson Ave","street":"500 N Vinson Ave","unit":null,"city":"Fayetteville","state":"AR","zip_code":"72701","beds":3,"full_baths":2,"half_baths":null,"sqft":1504,"year_built":1949,"days_on_mls":63,"list_price":430000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-03-14","sold_price":435000,"last_sold_date":"2025-05-16","assessed_value":50,"estimated_value":477500,"tax":2,"tax_history":[{"year":2024,"tax":2,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":50,"total":50}},{"year":2022,"tax":2,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":50,"total":50}},{"year":2021,"tax":5,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":100,"total":100}},{"year":2020,"tax":5,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":100,"total":100}},{"year":2018,"tax":6,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":120,"total":120}},{"year":2017,"tax":6,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":120,"total":120}},{"year":2016,"tax":1932,"assessment":{"building":null,"land":120,"total":120}},{"year":2015,"tax":1841,"assessment":{"building":23640,"land":10000,"total":33640}},{"year":2014,"tax":1664,"assessment":{"building":23640,"land":10000,"total":33640}},{"year":2013,"tax":1664,"assessment":{"building":20970,"land":10000,"total":30970}},{"year":2012,"tax":1664,"assessment":{"building":20970,"land":10000,"total":30970}},{"year":2011,"tax":1664,"assessment":{"building":20970,"land":10000,"total":30970}},{"year":2010,"tax":1680,"assessment":{"building":20970,"land":10000,"total":30970}},{"year":2009,"tax":1598,"assessment":{"building":20970,"land":10000,"total":30970}},{"year":2007,"tax":1354,"assessment":{"building":22044,"land":6600,"total":28644}},{"year":2005,"tax":1183,"assessment":{"building":17870,"land":6000,"total":23870}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":13939,"price_per_sqft":289,"latitude":36.070017,"longitude":-94.145948,"neighborhoods":"Southwest Sequoyah","county":"Washington","fips_code":"05143","stories":1,"hoa_fee":0,"parking_garage":2,"agent_id":"3797449","agent_name":"Katie Mihalevich","agent_email":"Katie@MihalevichGroup.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"4794227448"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-NWAR-78171","agent_nrds_id":"130078171","broker_id":"3384165","broker_name":"Flyer Homes Real Estate -
