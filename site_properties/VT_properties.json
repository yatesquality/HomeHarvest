cash flow well maintained 4plex located in quaint Brattleboro neighborhood within proximity to the vibrant downtown, listed at a deep-value 11% cap rate. This 100% occupied building has 2x 2br and 2x1br, and a net operating income of ~38K with significant upside based on rents over 20% below market. A new owner can step into to yield over a 15% cash on cash return starting year 1, and build wealth through high cash-flow vs speculation. Rents can be brought to market to achieve north of a 25% cash on cash (see proforma in OM). In addition to enjoying the tremendous cash flow, there is also significant upside to acquire a high quality stabilized 4plex with value-add from growing rents to market, ahead of the investment and resurgence going on in vibrant and desirable Brattleboro. The property is available as a package with other buildings in Brattleboro and in nearby towns for a buyer looking for a larger high cash flow turnkey multifamily portfolio.

6-unit fully-leased and cashflowing property is in great condition. With gross rents of $66, 000, expenses (including property taxes) of $14, 538, and net income of $51, 462, this investment property shows a 12.1% cap rate. With stable, long-term tenants on annual leases and fully-separated utilities in 5 of the 6 units, just about everything is taken care of. Built in 1970, the property is modern and easy to maintain. Two spacious 2-bedroom units feature charming hardwood floors, while two 1-bedrooms include beautiful large picture windows and recently-installed mini splits, and two top-floor studios offer a full range of apartment options. Located just minutes away from downtown Brattleboro and all that it has to offer, where rental demand is sky-high, the property hasn't had a vacancy in years. A spacious lot allows for off-street parking for all six tenants, and nearby attractions include hiking trails, the Brattleboro farmers market, and the ski hill. Recent upgrades to the property include new propane furnaces and hot water heaters, insulation and stucco, and new bath fans and vents. At a 12% cap rate with low rents and the potential to add easily installed coin-op laundry in the common area for additional income, this would be fantastic for any investor. Nice turn key building that doesn't need anything to start earning money. See it today.","style":"MULTI_FAMILY","full_street_line":"238 Marlboro Rd","street":"238 Marlboro Rd","unit":null,"city":"Brattleboro","state":"VT","zip_code":"05301","beds":6,"full_baths":6,"half_baths":null,"sqft":2880,"year_built":1970,"days_on_mls":47,"list_price":425000,"list_price_min":null,"list_price_max":null,"list_date":"2025-04-02","sold_price":365000,"last_sold_date":"2022-05-09","assessed_value":233800,"estimated_value":null,"tax":3753,"tax_history":[{"year":2023,"tax":3753,"assessment":{"building":142100,"land":91700,"total":233800}},{"year":2022,"tax":6808,"assessment":{"building":142100,"land":91700,"total":233800}},{"year":2021,"tax":6872,"assessment":{"building":142100,"land":91700,"total":233800}},{"year":2020,"tax":6784,"assessment":{"building":142100,"land":91700,"total":233800}},{"year":2019,"tax":6537,"assessment":{"building":142100,"land":91700,"total":233800}},{"year":2018,"tax":6524,"assessment":{"building":142100,"land":91700,"total":233800}},{"year":2017,"tax":6259,"assessment":{"building":142100,"land":91700,"total":233800}},{"year":2016,"tax":6258,"assessment":{"building":142100,"land":91700,"total":233800}},{"year":2015,"tax":6231,"assessment":{"building":142100,"land":91700,"total":233800}},{"year":2014,"tax":null,"assessment":{"building":142100,"land":91700,"total":233800}},{"year":2012,"tax":5871,"assessment":{"building":142100,"land":91700,"total":233800}},{"year":2011,"tax":5909,"assessment":{"building":142100,"land":91700,"total":233800}}],"new_construction":false,"lot_sqft":16117,"price_per_sqft":148,"latitude":42.864802,"longitude":-72.61249,"neighborhoods":null,"county":"Windham","fips_code":"50025","stories":3,"hoa_fee":null,"parking_garage":null,"agent_id":"998529","agent_name":"Steve Schoppmeyer","agent_email":"steveschoppmeyer@masiello.com","agent_phones":[{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Mobile","number":"6034993141"},{"ext":null,"primary":true,"type":"Office","number":"8022571111"}],"agent_mls_set":"A-NHVT-10601","agent_nrds_id":"85611666","broker_id":"986470","broker_name":"Better Homes & Gardens The Masiello Group","builder_id":null,"builder_name":null,"office_id":"1092816","office_mls_set":"O-NHVT-1657","office_name":"Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate The Masiello Group","office_email":"brattleboro@masiello.com","office_phones":[{"number":"8022571111","type":"Office","primary":true,"ext":null},{"number":"(802) 257-5672","type":"Fax","primary":false,"ext":null}],"nearby_schools":null,"primary_photo":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m372041741od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","alt_photos":"https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m372041741od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m3989990601od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m477465995od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m1005020810od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m2541464921od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m3754741404od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m911444590od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m1840061842od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m237405609od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m1152627982od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m2771009526od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m569569005od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m2289807731od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m542571757od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m1005020810od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m2541464921od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m3754741404od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, https:\/\/ap.rdcpix.com\/43e592f4315c0404339a2d1999ac5a75l-m911444590od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75","photos":null,"tour_3d_url":null},{"property_url":"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/realestateandhomes-detail\/62-Lawton-Dr_Brattleboro_VT_05301_M33668-86113","property_id":"3366886113","listing_id":"2981340661","mls":"NHVT","mls_id":"5039094","status":"PENDING","text":"Everything deserves a second chance, and this home found the right owner to love and recreate it in a stunning new life.

There is a garage\/gardening shed for your lawn tractor and gardening equipment, or tune it up and give your collectable car a new home. Age in place! Everything you need on the first floor with bed, bath and laundry. Newly renovated, this one sparkles and shines.

The dining room has new floors, paint and a propane heater that opens to the deck and a level yard. The labor of love continues throughout the first floor. The living room is bright with southeast light, 2 bedrooms and lovely bath with new windows and paint throughout. Upstairs is a versatile space, another large bedroom or office and certainly enough space for a potential bath. Besides the new windows there is an abundance of storage.

6-unit fully-leased and cashflowing property is in great condition. With gross rents of $66, 000, expenses (including property taxes) of $14, 538, and net income of $51, 462, this investment property shows a 12.1% cap rate. With stable, long-term tenants on annual leases and fully-separated utilities in 5 of the 6 units, just about everything is taken care of. Built in 1970, the property is modern and easy to maintain. Two spacious 2-bedroom units feature charming hardwood floors, while two 1-bedrooms include beautiful large picture windows and recently-installed mini splits, and two top-floor studios offer a full range of apartment options. Located just minutes away from downtown Brattleboro and all that it has to offer, where rental demand is sky-high, the property hasn't had a vacancy in years. A spacious lot allows for off-street parking for all six tenants, and nearby attractions include hiking trails, the Brattleboro farmers market, and the ski hill. Recent upgrades to the property include new propane furnaces and hot water heaters, insulation and stucco, and new bath fans and vents. At a 12% cap rate with low rents and the potential to add easily installed coin-op laundry in the common area for additional income, this would be fantastic for any investor. Nice turn key building that doesn't need anything to start earning money.

This 100% occupied building has 2x 2br and 2x1br, and a net operating income of ~38K with significant upside based on rents over 20% below market. A new owner can step into to yield over a 15% cash on cash return starting year 1, and build wealth through high cash-flow vs speculation. Rents can be brought to market to achieve north of a 25% cash on cash (see proforma in OM). In addition to enjoying the tremendous cash flow, there is also significant upside to acquire a high quality stabilized 4plex with value-add from growing rents to market, ahead of the investment and resurgence going on in vibrant and desirable Brattleboro. The property is available as a package with other buildings in Brattleboro and in nearby towns for a buyer looking for a larger high cash flow turnkey multifamily portfolio.
